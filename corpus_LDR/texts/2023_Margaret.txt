This is a simple song, gonna write it for a friend
My shirt is inside out, I'm messy with the pen
He met Margaret on a rooftop, she was wearin' white
And he was like, "I might be in trouble"
He had flashes of the good life, he was like
"Should I jump off this building now or do it on the double?"

[Pre-Chorus: Both]
'Cause, baby, if your love is in trouble
Baby, if your love is in trouble
Baby, if your love is in trouble

[Chorus: Both]
When you know, you know
When you know, you know
It kinda makes me laugh
Runnin' down that path
When you're good as gold
'Cause when you know, you know

[Verse 2: Jack Antonoff]
Word to all my friends
With their rеd flags, their white knights
Their black еyes and their blue lies
If you're askin' yourself, "How do you know?"
Then that's your answer, the answer is "No"
You gotta run, gotta run, run, run, run like your head's on fire
Run away like your head is on fire



[Pre-Chorus: Both]
'Cause, baby, if your love is in trouble
Baby, if your love is in trouble
Baby, if your love is in trouble

[Chorus: Both, Lana Del Rey]
When you know, you know
When you know, you know
It kinda makes me laugh
Runnin' down that path
When you're good as gold
'Cause when you know, you know
And when you're old, you're old
Like Hollywood and me
The diamond on your ring
The soul that you bring to the table
The one that makes me sing
In a minor key
'Cause when you know, you know
When you know, you know

[Interlude: Lana Del Rey]
So if you don't know, don't give up
'Cause you never know what the new day might bring

[Bridge: Both, Lana Del Rey]
Maybe tomorrow you'll know
Maybe tomorrow you'll know
Maybe tomorrow you'll know
I mean, join the party
By the way, the party is December 18
(Alright, let's waltz this out, kids)



[Chorus: Both, Lana Del Rey]
'Cause when you know, you know
And when you're old, you're old
Like Hollywood and me
That diamond on your ring
The soul that you bring to the table
The one that makes me sing
In a minor key
Diamond on your ring
'Cause when you know, you know
When you know, you know
