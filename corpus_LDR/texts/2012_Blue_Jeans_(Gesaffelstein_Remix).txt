Walked into the room, you know, you made my eyes burn
It was like James Dean, for sure
You're so freshed a doesn't sick as ca-cancer
You're sort a punk-rock, I grew on hip-hop

But you fit me better, than my favorite sweater
And I know, that love is mean, and love hurts
But I still remember that day, we meet on December, oh baby

[Chorus]
I will love you till the end of time, I would wait for a million
Years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby can you see through the tears
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember (oh, baby)
Say you'll remember (oh baby, ohhh)
I will love you till the end of time

Big dreams, gangster
Said: "You have to leave to star, your life over"
I was like: "No please, stay here"
We don't need no money, we can make it all work
But he headed on Sunday, said come home Monday
I stayed waitin', anticipating and pacing
But he was, chasing, paper
"Caught in the game" that was the last I heard



[Chorus]
I will love you till the end of time, I would wait a million
Years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby can you see throught the tears
Love you more than those bitches before

Say you'll remember (oh, baby)
Say you'll remember (oh baby, ohhh)
I will love you till the end of time

He went it every night, and baby that's alright
I told you that no matter what you did, I'd be your side
Cause I'm a ride or die, whatever fail or fly
Well, shit at least we tried
But when you walked to that door, a piece of me died
Don't you want any more, but he have any mind
Just want it like before, we were dancing all night
When they took you away, stole you all that my life
You just need to remember

[Chorus]
I will love you 'till the end of time, I would wait for a
Million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby can you see through the tears
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember (oh, baby)
Say you'll remember (oh baby, ohhh)
I will love you till the end of time
