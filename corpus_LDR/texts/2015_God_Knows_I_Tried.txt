Del Rey said the song is “Incredibly close to her heart” in an Instagram post of her Honeymoon page.



Sometimes, I wake up in the morning
To red, blue, and yellow skies
It's so crazy, I could drink it like tequila sunrise

[Pre-Chorus]
Put on that "Hotel California"
Dance around like I'm insane
I feel free when I see no one
And nobody knows my name

[Chorus]
God knows I lived
God knows I died
God knows I begged
Begged, borrowed, and cried
God knows I loved
God knows I lied
God knows I lost
God gave me life
And God knows I tried
God knows I tried
God knows I tried
God knows I tried

[Verse 2]
Sometimes, I wake up in the morning
To red, blue, and yellow lights
On Monday, they destroy me
But, by Friday, I'm revived



[Pre-Chorus]
Put on that "Hotel California"
Wear my blinders in the rain
I've got nothing much to live for
Ever since I found my fame

[Chorus]
God knows I lived
God knows I died
God knows I loved
God knows I lied
God knows I begged
Begged, borrowed, and cried
God knows I lost
God gave me life
And God knows I tried
God knows I tried
God knows I tried
God knows I tried

[Bridge]
So let there be light
Let there be light
Light up my life
Light up my life
Let there be light
Let there be light
Light up my life
Light up my life



[Outro]
And God knows I tried
God knows I tried
God knows I tried
God knows I tried
God knows I tried
God knows I tried
God knows I tried
God knows I tried
