Girls, don't forget your pearls and all of your horses
As you make your way across the pond
Girls, don't forget your curls and all of your corsets
Memorize them in a little song

[Pre-Chorus]
Shake it up, throw your hands up and get loose
Cut a rug, lean into the fuckin' youth
Choreo, we just want the fuckin' truth
(Told by the fake news)

[Chorus]
Is it the end of an era?
Is it the end of America?
Is it the end of an era?
Is it the end of America?
No, it's only the beginnin'
If we hold on to hope
We'll have our happy endin'
When the world was at war before
We just kept dancin'
When the world was at war before
We just kept dancin'

[Verse 2]
Boys, don't forget your toys and take all of your money
If you find you're in a foreign land
Boys, don't make too much noise and don't try to be funny
Other people may not understand



[Pre-Chorus]
Shake it up, throw your hands up and get loose
Cut a rug, lean into the fuckin' youth
Choreo, we just want the fuckin' truth
(Told by the fake news)

[Chorus]
Is it the end of an era?
Is it the end of America?
Is it the end of an era?
Is it the end of America?
No, it's only the beginnin'
If we hold on to hope
We'll have our happy endin'
When the world was at war before
We just kept dancin'
When the world was at war before
We just kept dancin'

[Bridge]
And we'll do it again
Oh my God, I'm dizzy from lovin' you
We'll do it again and again
Oh my God, I'm dizzy from lovin' you
We'll do it again
Dizzy from, dizzy from lovin' you
We'll do it again
In a world at war (Mmm)



[Chorus]
Is it the end of an era?
Is it the end of America?
Is it the end of an era?
Is it the end of America?
When the world was at war before
We just kept dancin'
When the world was at war before
We just kept dancin'

[Outro]
And we'll do it again
And we'll do it again
