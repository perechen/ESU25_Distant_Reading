White fire, cinnamon on my teeth
And I'm sittin' at the stoplight northern town
I feel lucky
I drive somewhere out of range, I don't know where
White noise comin' all in my brain
Turns off for nothing

[Pre-Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
Rockafella, my umbrella
God, I love you, baby
Storyteller, us forever
Is my favorite song

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
You've been actin' pretty restless
Dancin' like the young and restless
And I'm obsessed with it
Candy necklaces
You've been actin' pretty reckless
Dancin' like the young and restless
And I'm obsessеd with this
All his candy necklaces

[Verse 2: Lana Del Rey]
Sittin' on the sofa, feelin' supеr suicidal
Hate to say the word, but, baby, hand on the Bible, I do
Feel like it's you, the one who's bringin' me down
Thought that we were cool and we were kickin' it like Tribe Called Quest
You the best, but, baby, you've been bringin' me down
I can see it now



[Pre-Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
Rockafella, my umbrella
God, I love you, baby
Fortune teller, favorite ever
That's the story of us

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
You've been actin' pretty restless
Dancin' like the young and reckless
And I'm obsessed with this
Candy necklaces
I think that we should address this
Actin' like the young and restless
I'm obsessed with this
All his candy necklaces

[Piano Solo]

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
We've been actin' pretty restless
Dancin' like the young and restless
I'm obsessed with this
Candy necklaces

[Outro: Jon Batiste, Lana Del Rey & Jon Batiste, Lana Del Rey]
Candy necklaces
Candy necklaces
Candy necklaces
Candy necklaces (Mm)
Candy necklaces (Mm, hmm)
Candy necklaces (I'm obsessed with this)
Candy necklaces
Candy necklaces
Candy necklaces ('Cause I'm obsessed with this)
Candy necklaces (Mm)
Candy necklaces
Candy necklaces
Candy necklaces
Candy necklaces
Candy necklaces, oh
