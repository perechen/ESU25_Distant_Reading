The title refers to the amount of hours in a day, which Lana mourns as she puts time into a troublesome lover.



There's only twenty-four hours in a day
And half as many ways for you to lie to me, my little love
There's only twenty-four hours in a day
And half of those, you lay awake
With thoughts of murder and carnage

[Pre-Chorus]
If you lie down with dogs, then you'll get fleas
Be careful of the company you keep

[Chorus]
There's only twenty-four hours
And that's not enough
To lie like you lie
Or love like you love

[Post-Chorus]
Hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm

[Verse 2]
There's only twenty-four hours in a day
And half of those you lay
Between the sheets with me, my lying love
There's only twenty-four hours, so you'd say
For most of them you pay
For all the things they paid you for, my love



[Pre-Chorus]
If you lie down with dogs, then you'll get fleas
Be careful of the ones you choose to leave

[Chorus]
There's only twenty-four hours
And that's not enough
To lie like you lie
Or love like you love

[Post-Chorus]
Hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm

[Bridge]
Give me your heat
Give me your diamonds
You hit that street
And my crooked words
You count to three
While they're all dying
You're hard to reach
You're cold to touch

[Outro]
La-da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-di-da-da-da
