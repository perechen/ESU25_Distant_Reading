Flames so hot that they turn blue
Palms reflecting in your eyes
Like an endless summer
That's the way I feel for you
If time stood still, I'd take this moment, make it last forever

[Pre-Chorus]
Your halo's full of fire
I'm rising up, rising up
My hot love's full of fire
Love's full of fire
La, ah

[Chorus]
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too
Screw your anonymity, loving me is all you need
To feel like I do
We could slow dance to rock music, kiss while we do it
Talk 'til we both turn blue
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too

[Verse 2]
Leather black and eyes of blue (Blue, blue, blue)
Sun reflecting in your eyes
Like an easy rider
Life makes sense when I'm with you
Looking back, my past
It all seems stranger than a stranger



[Pre-Chorus]
So let's dance in slow motion
Tear it up, tear it up
And let's dance by the ocean
Ah, ah

[Chorus]
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California (Hmm-hmm-mmm-mmm)
Be a freak like me, too
Screw your anonymity, loving me is all you need (Hmm-hmm-mmm-mmm)
To feel like I do
We could slow dance to rock music, kiss while we do it
Talk 'til we both turn blue
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California (Hmm-hmm-mmm-mmm)
Be a freak like me, too

[Bridge]
Ooh-ooh
You're cold as ice, baby
But when you're nice, baby
You're so amazing in every way
Ooh-ooh
You're cold as ice, baby
I don't wanna fight, baby
It's like I told you
If you stay, I'll stay (yeah)



[Chorus]
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California (Hmm-hmm-mmm-mmm)
Be a freak like me, too
(Take it to the back if you really wanna talk)
Screw your anonymity, loving me is all you need
To feel like I do
(Take it to the back if you really wanna talk)
We could slow dance to rock music, kiss while we do it
Talk 'til we both turn blue
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California (Hmm-hmm-mmm-mmm)
Be a freak like me, too

[Outro]
Hmm-hmm-mmm-mmm
