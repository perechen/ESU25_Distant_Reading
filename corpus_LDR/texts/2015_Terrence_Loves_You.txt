You are what you are
I don't matter to anyone
But Hollywood legends
Will never grow old
And though our love was hidden
Well, it will never grow cold

[Chorus]
But I lost myself when I lost you
But I still got jazz when I've got those blues
And I lost myself when I lost you
And I still get trashed, darling, when I hear your tunes

[Verse 2]
But you are who you are
I won't change you for anything
For when you are crazy
I'll let you be bad
I'll never dare change thee
To what you are not

[Chorus]
But I lost myself when I lost you
But I still got jazz when I've got those blues
I lost myself and I lost you, too
And I still get trashed, baby, when I hear your tunes



[Bridge]
I put the radio on, hold you tight in my mind
Isn't strange that you're not here with me
I'm putting all the lights on and the television
Trying to transmit, can you hear me?
Ground control to Major Tom
Can you hear me all night long?
Ground control to Major Tom

[Chorus]
Well, I lost myself when I lost you
But I still got jazz when I've got the blues
I lost myself and I lost you, too
And I still get trashed, honey, when I hear your tunes

[Outro]
Mmm, mmm, mmm-mmm-mmm
Mmm, mmm-mmm-mmm
