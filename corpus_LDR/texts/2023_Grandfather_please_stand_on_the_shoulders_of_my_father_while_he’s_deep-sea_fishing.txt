Three white butterflies to know you're near

[Verse]
I know they think that it took somebody else
To make me beautiful, beautiful
As they intended me to be
But they're wrong
I know they think that it took thousands of people
To put me together again like an experiment
Some big men behind the scenes
Sewing Frankenstein black dreams into my songs
But they're wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
God, if you'rе near me, send mе three white butterflies
Or an owl to know you're listening, sitting while I'm drinking

[Chorus]
Grandfather, please stand on the shoulders of my father
While he's deep-sea fishing for sharks in the Pacific

[Bridge]
'Cause I'm good in spirit, warm-bodied
A fallible deity wrapped up in white
I'm folk, I'm jazz, I'm blue, I'm green
Regrettably, also a white woman
But I have good intentions even if I'm one of the last ones
If you don't believe me, my poetry, or my melodies
Feel it in your bones
I have good intentions even if I'm one of the last ones
(Ah, yeah, ah, yeah, ah, yeah, oh)



[Chorus]
Grandfather, please stand on the shoulders of my father
While he's deep-sea fishing for all the things he's wishing
God, if you're near me, send me three white butterflies
Or a map to know your vision, impart on me your wisdom

[Post-Chorus]
It took somebody else to make me beautiful, wonderful
As they intended me to be
But they're wrong

[Outro]
Three white butterflies to know you're near
