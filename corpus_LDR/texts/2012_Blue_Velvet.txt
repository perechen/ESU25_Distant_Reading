Mmm

[Verse 1]
She wore blue velvet
Bluer than velvet was the night
Softer than satin was the light
From the stars

[Verse 2]
She wore blue velvet
Bluer than velvet were her eyes
Warmer than May, her tender sighs
Love was ours

[Bridge]
Ours a love I held tightly
Feeling the rapture grow
Like a flame burning brightly
But when she left, gone was the glow of

[Verse 3]
Blue velvet
But in my heart there'll always be
Precious and warm a memory
Through the years



[Outro]
And I still can see blue velvet through my tears
