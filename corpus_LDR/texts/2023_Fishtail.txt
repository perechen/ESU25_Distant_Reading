Don't you dare say that you'll braid my hair, babe
If you don't really care
You wanted me sadder, you wanted me sadder
Fishtail, what's the matter with that?

[Verse 1]
Skippin' rope in the bayou, bayou
Slip softly in terrain
Not that smart, but I've got things to say
Palm trees in black and white
I like to watch them sway
You're so funny, I wish I could skinny-dip inside your mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Lately, I've been thinkin' about how things used to be
Swingin' in a nightgown underneath the old oak tree
Almost Victorian with you, you can talk to me
But, lately, I can see

[Chorus]
You wanted me sadder (Baby)
You wanted me sadder
Can't you see it?
For me, you are the one
And if I'm not the one for you, don't just say it
I was on the stairs, Ella Fitzgerald in the air
Feelin' hella rare
Baby, if you care
Baby, don't you dare say
You'll braid my hair, babe
Don't you dare say that you'll braid my hair, babe
If you don't really care
You wanted me sadder



[Verse 2]
Dancin' there in the hot, hot sun
I know that we've got problems
I plan to address them another day
Palm trees in black and white
I see in technicolor
Maybe I'll take my glasses off so I stop painting red flags green

[Pre-Chorus]
Lately, I've been sunnin' in the L.A. riverbed
Wearin' nothin' but the summer bruises on my knees
I like how you talk, how you speak, how you look at me
But, lately, I can see

[Chorus]
You wanted me sadder (Baby)
You wanted me sadder
You wanted me sadder
Can't you see it?
For me, you are the one and if I'm not the one for you
Don't just say it
I was on the stairs, Ella Fitzgerald in the air
Feelin' hella rare
Baby, if you care
Baby, don't you dare say
You'll braid my hair, see
Baby, if you care, then
Baby, don't you dare say
That you really care
Don't you dare say that you'll braid my hair
When you get home tonight
If you don't really care
Yeah, don't you dare say that you'll braid my hair, babe
If you don't really care, see
Don't you braid my hair
If you're not coming home to me
Ah-ah



[Outro]
You want someone sadder
Skippin' rope in the bayou, bayou
Slip softly in terrain
I'm not that smart
But I've got things to say
