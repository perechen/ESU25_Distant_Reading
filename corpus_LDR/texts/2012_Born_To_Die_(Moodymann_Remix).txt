Why to die?
Why to die?
Why to die?
Why to die?

[Refrain]
We were born to die
We were born to die
We were born to die
We were born to die

[Verse 1]
But I'm hoping that the gates, they'll tell me that you're mine
Walking through the city streets, is it by mistake or design?
I feel so alone on a Friday night, Friday night
Can you make it feel like home if I tell you you're mine?
It's like I told you, honey

[Pe-Chorus]
You like your girls insane
Why?
You like your girls insane
Why?
You like your girls insane
Why?



[Refrain]
We were born to die
We were born to die
We were born to die
We were born to die

[Verse 2]
I was so confused as a little child
Tried to take what I could get, scared that I couldn't find
All the answers, honey

[Pe-Chorus]
Why?
'Cayse you and I
We were born to die
Why?
You like your girls insane
Why?
You like your girls insane
Why?
You like your girls insane
Why?

[Refrain]
We were born to die



[Interlude]
Why to die?
You're mine, to die
Tried to take, why?
To die, you're mine, to die
Why to die?
You're mine, to die
Tried to take, why?
To die, you're mine, to die
Take me to the finish line (Why to die?)
I can see that, once, I was blind (You're mine, to die)
Take me to the finish line (Tried to take, why?)
I can see that, once, I was blind (To die, you're mine, to die)
Why to die?
You're mine, to die
Tried to take, why?
To die, you're mine, to die
Why to die?
You're mine, to die
Tried to take, why?
To die, you're mine, to die
Why to die?
You're mine, to die
Tried to take, why?
To die, you're mine, to die
Why to die?
You're mine, to die
Tried to take, why?
To die, you're mine, to die



[Outro]
Why?
Why?
