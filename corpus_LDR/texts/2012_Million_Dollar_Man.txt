You said I was the most exotic flower
Holdin' me tight in our final hour
I don't know how you convince them and get them, babe
I don't know what you do, it's unbelievable
And I don't know how you get over, get over
Someone as dangerous, tainted and flawed as you

[Chorus]
One for the money and two for the show
I love you, honey, I'm ready, I'm ready to go
How did you get that way? I don't know
You're screwed up and brilliant
Look like a million dollar man
So why is my heart broke?

[Verse 2]
You've got the world, but baby, at what price?
Something so strange, hard to define
It isn't that hard, boy, to like you or love you
I'd follow you down, down, down, you're unbelievable
If you're goin' crazy, just grab me and take me
I'd follow you down, down, down anywhere, anywhere

[Chorus]
One for the money, two for the show
I love you, honey, I'm ready, I'm ready to go
How did you get that way? I don't know
You're screwed up and brilliant
Look like a million dollar man
So why is my heart broke?



[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
One for the money and two for the show
I love you, honey, I'm ready, I'm ready to go
How did you get that way? I don't know
You're screwed up and brilliant
Look like a million dollar man
So why is my heart broke?

[Outro]
I don't know
You're screwed up and brilliant
Look like a million dollar man
So why is my heart broke?
