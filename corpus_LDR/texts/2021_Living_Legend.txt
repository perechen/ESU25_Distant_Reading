Hmm, oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Blackbirds will sing in the same key
As you play in the shoes that I bought you
And sweet baby Jane don't know a thing
About my songs, but she knows I'm a monsoon

[Chorus]
And, baby, you, all the things you do
And the ways you move, send me straight to Heaven
And, baby, you, what you never knew
What I never said is you're my living legend

[Verse 2]
Hipsters will sing just like a dream
In Sin-é or the back Brooklyn bayou
But you never cared about my name
And, darling, I never meant to defy you

[Chorus]
But baby, you, all them things you do
And those ways you moved, send me straight to Heaven
And baby you, I never said to you
You really are my living legend



[Bridge]
I got guns in the summertime and horses, too
Guns in the summertime and horses, too
I never meant to be bad or unwell
I was just living on the edge
Right between Heaven and Hell
And I'm tired of it

[Chorus]
Oh, all the things you do
And the ways you move, send me straight to Heaven
And, baby, you, what I never said to you
'Cause you really are my living legend

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
My living legend
My living legend
My living legend
My living legend
