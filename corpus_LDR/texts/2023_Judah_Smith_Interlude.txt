Don't you understand what that means?
It means quit lusting after your neighbor
That's a heck of a life
You get to love your children in front of you
You get to love
You ever talk to somebody
"I want a new life"
"I don't love my wife anymore"
"I don't love my kids anymore"
"I'm missing out on life"
They're usually my age
Does that sound like love?
It's a life dominated with lust
And for too long, they've been holding it off
And finally, they just get weak and they say
"It doesn't matter anymore"
And the Spirit of God says
"I'll infuse you with dеsires for what you have
And what's in front of you" (Yeah, yеah, yeah)
(Desires for what you have)
So, as He works deep in your heart
As you call out to Him and say
"I'm here, do it in me, Man"
"Help me want what I got"
"Help me love what's in front of me"
"Help me want more of my wife and more of my friends"
"And help me serve the city I live in and not wish it away and hope I can move"
"Help me, God"
"I wanna be a man of love, not a man of lust"
But you've gotta do that
So I bring you to this verse and I'm done, I'm done
Psalms, chapter eight
And you know where I got this verse?
This is gonna sound crazy to you, but I'm gonna tell you the absolute truth
It's gonna make me sound so spiritual, so I'm looking forward to it
I woke up this morning and God said, "Check the Bible app"
I don't know if it was God, but it felt like God
And I had the thought in my head, “Check the Bible app”
I'm gonna speak to you from the verse of the day
That means I don't have to do anything
I don't have to look anywhere, I just get the verse of the day
So I get to the verse of the day
And here's the verse of the day, today, in the Bible app
Look at this (That's cool)
"Look at the splendor of the skies
Your creative genius glowing in the heavens
When I gaze, when I gaze at Your moon and Your stars
Mounted like jewels in their settings
I know You are the fascinating artist who fashioned it all"
When I look up and I see such wonder and workmanship above
"I have to ask this question"
"I've gotta ask this question"
Compared to all this cosmic glory
"Why would you ever bother with puny, mortal man?" or be
Ooh, don't get me started on it
I could preach for another hour on infatuated
Or be infatuated with Adam's son
"Why are you so infatuated with me?"
You're the star creator, You're the ocean maker (Yeah, yeah)
You're the whale creator, you're the rhino designer
Who, who are you? (Rhino designer)
And then it goes on in verse five
And it says
"Yet, what honor You have given to me
Created only a little lower than Elohim"
Which is the name of Creator God, Artist God
You wanna call God "Artist"?
At some point tonight, before you go to bed, go, "Yo, Elohim"
And He'll hear, "You're the best Artist ever"
"The little Elohim, crowned like kings and queens with glory and magnificence
You have delighted, You have delegated to them
Mastery over all You have made"
You have made me a partner with You
I used to think my preaching was mostly about You
And you're not gonna like this, but I'm gonna tell you the truth
I've discovered my preaching is mostly about me
