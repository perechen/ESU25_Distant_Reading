(You alright?)

[Chorus: Tommy Genesis, Both]
Hands on your knees, I'm Angelina Jolie
Hands on your knees, Angelina Jolie
Let me put my hands on your knees, you can braid my hair
Do a fat criss-cross in the back somewhere, ha

[Verse 1: Lana Del Rey]
Me and my boyfriend listen to the Chili Peppers
We write hit songs without tryin’ like
All the time, all the time
I take off all my clothes, dance naked for the neighbors
I'm like, "Fuck it, gonna give a show," I open up the blinds

[Pre-Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
I threw caution to the wind, get onto the bike
Take a minute to yourself, skinny-dip in my mind
I'm in love, I’m in love
Got a knife in my jacket, honey on the vine
Baby, I'll bring the coffee if you bring the wine
I'm in love, I'm in love ('Cause I'm in love)

[Chorus: Tommy Genesis, Lana Del Rey, Both]
Hands on your knees, I'm Angelina Jolie
Hands on your knees, Angelina Jolie
Let me put my hands on your knees, you can braid my hair
Do a fat criss-cross in the back somewhere, ha
Hands on your knees, I'm Angelina Jolie
Hands on your knees, Angelina Jolie
Let me put my hands on your knees, you can braid my hair
Do a fat criss-cross in the back somewhere, ha



[Verse 2: Lana Del Rey]
I sit, upskirt, I don’t have much to lose
I got a truck, I take it for a midnight, a midnight drive, yeah
My boyfriend tested positive for COVID, it don’t matter
We've been kissing, so whatever he has, I have, I can’t cry

[Pre-Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
I threw caution to the wind, get onto the bike
Take a minute for myself, skinny-dip in my mind
I'm in love, I'm in love (I'm in love)

[Chorus: Tommy Genesis]
Hands on your knees, I’m Angelina Jolie
Hands on your knees, Angelina Jolie
Let me put my hands on your knees, you can braid my hair
Do a fat criss-cross in the back somewhere, ha

[Spoken Bridge]
I don't know, maybe we should do something like, like merge this song
You know that song, "Wipeout"? Yeah, dance type of song

[Chorus: Tommy Genesis, Both]
Hands on your knees, I'm Angelina Jolie
Hands on your knees, Angelina Jolie
Let me put my hands on your knees, you can braid my hair
Do a fat criss-cross in the back somewhere, ha
Hands on your knees, I'm Angelina Jolie
Hands on your knees, Angelina Jolie
Let me put my hands on your knees, you can braid my hair
Do a fat criss-cross in the back somewhere, ha
Hands on your knees, I'm Angelina Jolie
Hands on your knees, Angelina Jolie
Let me put my hands on your knees, you can braid my hair
Do a fat criss-cross in the back somewhere, ha
Hands on your knees, I'm Angelina Jolie
Hands on your knees, Angelina Jolie
Let me put my hands on your knees, you can braid my hair
Do a fat criss-cross in the back somewhere, ha
