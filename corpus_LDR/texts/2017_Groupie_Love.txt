You're in the bar playin' guitar
I'm tryin' not to let the crowd next to me
It's so hard sometimes with a star
When you have to share him with everybody
You're in the club livin' it up
I'm trying not to let the crowd notice me
It's so sweet swingin' to the beat
When I know that you're doin' it all for me
(You're doin' it all for me, babe; That's right)

[Pre-Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
And every time you look up
I know what you're thinkin' of
I know what you're thinkin' of
You want my

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey, A$AP Rocky]
Groupie love
Groupie love
Groupie love (That's right)

[Verse 2: Lana Del Rey]
Time after time, writing my lines
Havin' my baby there next to me (You're right there, baby)
It's so sweet pourin' you a drink
And pretendin' that nothin' means anything (Nothin' means anything)
This is my life, you by my side (Ooh)
Key lime and perfume and festivals
Taking our dreams, turning them to things
It's like magic, babe, isn't life wonderful? (Mm)



[Pre-Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
And every time we hook up
I know what you're thinkin' of
I know what you're thinkin' of
You want my

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
Groupie love
Groupie love
Groupie love

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky, Lana Del Rey, A$AP Rocky & Lana Del Rey]
Front row, every show like a hype man (Mmm)
Sing along, word for word, watchin' my bae (Yeah)
Side stage, fans screamin' causin' migraines
Yamborghini-high, but she ain't on my grade (Uh-uh)
God dang, got a nigga actin' irate (Yeah; Uh)
My babe, my babe, stay on my brain (Yeah)
My babe, made me sing to a fire escape
City girl though she grew up in the tri-state
She ain't got no time for no groupie love (Mm)
We don't pay no minds to the thug with a ***** up (Mm)
Girl, it's you and I, so who do we trust? (Ooh)
You and I (Ooh) 'til the day we die (Ooh)

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky & Lana Del Rey, A$AP Rocky]
Groupie love
Groupie love
Groupie love
You are my babe
Groupie love
Groupie love
Groupie love



[Outro: A$AP Rocky & Lana Del Rey]
Groupie love
