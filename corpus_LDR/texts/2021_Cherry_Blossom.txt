What you don't tell no one, you can tell me
Little ghost, tall, tan like milk and honey
You're very brave
And very free

[Chorus]
I push you high, cherry blossom on your sycamore tree
What you don't tell no one, you can tell me

[Verse 2]
Swing it high like Jesus, wild and free
Dandelions in your hair, baby
You're very brave
And there's much to see

[Chorus]
I push you high, cherry blossom on your sycamore tree
What you don't tell no one, you can tell me

[Bridge]
And when you're scared, I'll be right here
You feel afraid, Mommy is there
It's a cruel, cruel world, but we don't care
'Cause what we've got, we've got to share



[Verse 3]
What you don't tell no one, you can tell me
Little ghost, blonde hair with lemonade tea
There's much to learn
And so much to see

[Chorus]
I push you high, Angelina, on your sycamore tree
What you don't tell no one, you can tell me
