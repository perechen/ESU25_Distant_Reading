Baby, you understand me now
If sometimes you see that I'm mad
Don't you know no one alive can always be an angel?
When everything goes wrong, you see some bad

[Chorus]
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh, Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

[Verse 2]
You know sometimes, baby, I'm so carefree
With a joy that's hard to hide
And then sometimes again, it seems that all I have is worry
And then you're bound to see my other side

[Chorus]
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh, Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

[Bridge]
If I seem edgy, I want you to know
I never meant to take it out on you
Life has its problems and I get more than my share
But that's one thing I never mean to do 'cause I love you



[Verse 3]
Oh, baby, I'm just human
Don't you know I have faults like anyone?
Sometimes I find myself alone regretting some little foolish thing
Yeah, some simple thing that I've done

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh, Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

[Outro]
I try so hard, don't let me be misunderstood
I try so hard, don't let me be misunderstood
