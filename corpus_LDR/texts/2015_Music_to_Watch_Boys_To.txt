(I like you a lot)
Putting on my music while I'm watching the boys
(So I do what you want)
Singing soft grunge just to soak up the noise
(With ribbons in knots)
Play 'em like guitars, only one of my toys
('Cause I like you a lot)
No holds barred, I was sent to destroy, yeah

[Verse 1]
Pink flamingos
Always fascinated me
I know what only the girls know
Hoes with lies akin to me

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I see you're going
So I play my music, watch you leave

[Chorus]
(I like you a lot)
Putting on my music while I'm watching the boys
(So I do what you want)
Singing soft grunge just to soak up the noise
(With ribbons in knots)
Play 'em like guitars, only one of my toys
('Cause I like you a lot)
No holds barred, I was sent to destroy, yeah



[Verse 2]
Velveteen and living single
It never felt that right to me
I know what only the girls know
Lies can buy eternity

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I see you leaving
So I push record and watch you leave

[Chorus]
(I like you a lot)
Putting on my music while I'm watching the boys
(So I do what you want)
Singing soft grunge just to soak up the noise
(With ribbons in knots)
Play 'em like guitars, only one of my toys
('Cause I like you a lot)
No holds barred, I was sent to destroy, yeah

[Bridge]
I live to love you and I love to love you
And I live to love you, boy
I live to love you and I love to love you
And I live to love you, boy
Nothing gold can stay
Like love or lemonade
Or sun or summer days
It's all a game to me anyway



[Chorus]
(I like you a lot)
Putting on my music while I'm watching the boys
(So I do what you want)
Singing soft grunge just to soak up the noise
(With ribbons in knots)
Play 'em like guitars, only one of my toys
('Cause I like you a lot)
No holds barred, I was sent to destroy, yeah

[Outro]
Putting on my music while I'm watching the boys
Putting on my music while I'm watching the boys
