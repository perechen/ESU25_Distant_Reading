There's somethin' in the wind, I can feel it blowin' in
It's comin' in softly on the wings of a bomb
There's somethin' in the wind, I can feel it blowin' in
It's comin' in hotly and it's coming in strong

[Refrain]
Lately, I've been thinkin' it's just someone else's job to care
Who am I to sympathize when no one gave a damn?
I've been thinkin' it's just someone else's job to care
Who am I to wanna try? But

[Pre-Chorus]
Change is a powerful thing, people are powerful beings
Tryin' to find the power in me to be faithful
Change is a powerful thing, I feel it comin' in me
Maybe by the time summer's done
I'll be able to be honest, capable
Of holdin' you in my arms without lettin' you fall
When I don't feel beautiful or stable
Maybe it's enough to just be where we are because

[Chorus]
Every time that we run, we don't know what it's from
Now we finally slow down, we feel close to it
There's a change gonna come, I don't know where or when
But whenever it does, we'll be here for it



[Verse 2]
There's somethin' in the wind, I can feel it blowin' in
It's comin' in softly on the wings of a song
There's somethin' in the water, I can taste it turnin' sour
It's bitter, I'm coughing, but now it's in my blood

[Refrain]
Lately, I've been thinkin' it's just someone else's job to care
Who am I to sympathize when no one gave a damn?
I've been thinkin' it's just someone else's job to care
'Cause who am I to wanna try? But

[Pre-Chorus]
Change is a powerful thing, people are powerful beings
Tryin' to find the power in me to be faithful
Change is a powerful thing, I feel it comin' in me
Maybe by the time summer's done
I'll be able to be honest, capable
Of holdin' you in my arms without letting you fall
When I don't feel beautiful or stable
Maybe it's enough to just be where we are, because

[Chorus]
Every time that we run, we don't know what it's from
Now we finally slow down, we feel close to it
There's a change gonna come, I don't know where or when
But whenever it does, we'll be here for it



[Outro]
Mmm
Yeah, whenever it does, we'll be here for it
Mmm
Whenever it does, we'll be here for it
