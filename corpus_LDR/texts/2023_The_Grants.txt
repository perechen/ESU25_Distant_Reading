One, two, ready
I'm gonna take mine with you with me
Ah, "mine," say it again
"Mine of you with me," thank you, one more time
One, two, ready
I'm gonna take mine of you with me
I'm gonna take mine of you with me
I'm gonna take mine of you with me
Like "Rocky Mountain High," the way John Denver sings

[Verse 1]
So you say there's a chance for us
Should I do a dance for once?
You're a family man, but
But

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you think about Heaven?
Oh-oh, do you think about me?
My pastor told me when you leave, all you take
Oh-oh, is your memory

[Chorus]
And I'm gonna take minе of you with me
I'm gonna take mine of you with mе



[Verse 2]
So many mountains too high to climb
So many rivers so long, but I'm
Doin' the hard stuff, I'm doin' my time
I'm doin' it for us, for our family line

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you think about Heaven?
Oh-oh, do you think about me?
My pastor told me (I'll do it, I'll do it)
When you leave, all you take (I did it, I did it)
Oh-oh, is your memories

[Chorus]
And I wanna take mine of you with me
I'm gonna take mine of you with me
Yeah, I'm gonna take mine of you with me
Like "Rocky Mountain High," the way John Denver sings

[Bridge]
My sister's first-born child
I'm gonna take that too with me
My grandmother's last smile (Ah)
I'm gonna take that too with me
It's a beautiful life (Ah)
Remember that too for me



[Outro]
Ah
Ah
Ah, ah
