"Hey, what you doin'?" Not a lot
Shakin' and movin' at my local spot
Baby, don't ask me why, don't ask me why
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why

[Pre-Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
Lay, Lady, lay on that side of a paradise
In the Tropic of Cancer
'Cause if I had my way, you would always stay
And I'd be your tiny dancer, honey

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
I waited for you
In the spot you said to wait
In the city, on the park bench
In the middle of the pourin' rain
'Cause I adored you
I just wanted things to be the same
You said to meet me up there tomorrow
But tomorrow never came
Tomorrow never came

[Verse 2: Sean Lennon]
Hey, what you thinkin'? Penny for your thoughts
Those lights are blinkin' on that old jukebox
But don't ask me why, just swallow some wine
Wi-wi-wi-wi-wi-wi-wine



[Pre-Chorus: Sean Lennon]
Stay, baby, stay on the side of a paradise
In the Tropic of Cancer
'Cause if I had my way, you would always stay
And you'd be my tiny dancer, baby

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey & Sean Lennon]
I waited for you
In the spot you said to wait
In the city, on the park bench
In the middle of the pourin' rain
'Cause I adored you
And I just wanted things to be the same
You said you'd meet me up there tomorrow
But tomorrow never came
Tomorrow never came

[Bridge: Lana Del Rey & Sean Lennon, Lana Del Rey]
Roses out in your country ho-ouse
We played guitar in your barn
And every day felt like Sunday
And I, I wish we had stayed home
And I could put on the radio to our favorite song
Lennon and Yoko, we would play all day long
"Isn't life crazy?," I said
Now that I'm singin' with Sean, woah



[Chorus: Lana Del Rey & Sean Lennon]
I could keep waitin' for you
In the spot we'd always wait
In the city, on the park bench
In the summer, on the pourin' rain
Honey, don't ignore me
I just wanted it to be the same
You said you'd love me like no tomorrow
I guess tomorrow never came

[Outro: Lana Del Rey, Lana Del Rey & Sean Lennon]
No, no, no
Tomorrow never came
Oh no
Tomorrow never came
No, no, no
Tomorrow never came
