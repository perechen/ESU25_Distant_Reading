Take me as I am, take me, baby, in stride
Only you can save me tonight
There's nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
You let me in, don't leave me out or leave me dry

[Pre-Chorus]
Even when I'm alone, I'm not lonely
I hear the sweetest melodies (Sweetest melodies)
On the fire escapes of the city
Sounds like I am free (It's got me singin')

[Chorus]
God bless America and all the beautiful women in it
God bless America and all the beautiful women in it
May you stand proud and strong like Lady Liberty shinin' all night long
God bless America

[Verse 2]
Take me as I am, don't see me for what I'm not
Only you can hear me tonight
Keep your light on, babe, I might be standin' outside
You let me in, don't leave me out or leave me dry

[Pre-Chorus]
Even walkin' alone, I'm not worried
I feel your arms all around me (Arms around me)
In the air on the streets of the city
Feels like I am free (It's got me thinkin')



[Chorus]
God bless America and all the beautiful women in it
God bless America and all the beautiful women in it
May you stand proud and strong like Lady Liberty shinin' all night long
God bless America

[Bridge]
(Sweetest melodies)
Even when you walk that walk with the lights on
You better believe it, nobody can make me feel lonely
Because I hear (Sweetest melodies)
Even when you talk that talk with the lights on
I still, somehow, know that I'll never feel, ever feel lonely
I have no fear (It's got me thinkin', yeah)

[Chorus]
God bless America and all the beautiful women in it
(Even when you talk that talk with the lights on)
(I still, somehow, know, yeah, I know that I'll never feel lonely)
(I have no fear)
God bless America and all the beautiful people in it
(Even when you walk that walk with the lights on)
(I still, somehow, know, yeah, I know that I'll never feel lonely)
(I have no fear)
May they stand proud and strong like Lady Liberty shinin' all night long
God bless America and all the beautiful people in it
And all the beautiful people in it
