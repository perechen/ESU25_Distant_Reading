I'm smokin' while I'm runnin'
On my treadmill, but I'm comin' up roses
Could it be that I fell for another loser?
I'm cryin' while I'm cummin'
Makin' love while I'm makin' good money
Sobbin' in my cup of coffee 'cause I fell for another loser

[Pre-Chorus]
Get that cigarette smoke out of my face
You've been wastin' my time while you're takin' what's mine
With the things that you're doin'
Talk that talk, well, now they all know your name
And there's no comin' back from the place that you came
Baby, don't do it

[Chorus]
'Cause you got me in my feelings (Got me feeling so much right now)
Talkin' in my sleep again (I'm makin' no sense at all)
Talkin' while I'm screamin' (Got me feelin' so crazy right now)
Who's doper than this bitch? Who's freer than me?
You wanna make the switch? Be my guest, baby
I'm feelin' all my fuckin' feelings

[Verse 2]
I'm smokin' while I'm runnin'
This town and you better believe it, honey
I'm laughin' as I'm taking no prisoners and taking down names
I'm cryin' while I'm gunnin'
In the smoke, they can hear me comin'
If you were me and I was you, I'd get out of my way



[Pre-Chorus]
Get that cigarette smoke out of my face
You've been wastin' my time while you're takin' what's mine
Well, you know what you're doin'
Talk that talk, well, now they all know your name
And there's no comin' back from the place that you came
Baby, don't do it

[Chorus]
'Cause you got me in my feelings (Got me feeling so much right now)
Talkin' in my sleep again (I'm makin' no sense at all)
Talkin' while I'm screamin' (Got me feelin' so crazy right now)
Who's doper than this bitch? Who's freer than me?
You wanna make the switch? Be my guest, baby
I'm feelin' all my fuckin' feelings

[Bridge]
Got me up in this place right now
Makin' no sense at all
Got me up in this place right now
Against the wall
Got me feelin' so blue
Makin' no sense at all
Gotta leave right now

[Chorus]
'Cause you got me in my feelings (Got me feeling so much right now)
Talkin' in my sleep again (I'm makin' no sense at all)
Talkin' while I'm screamin' (Got me feelin' so crazy right now)
Who's doper than this bitch? Who's freer than me?
You wanna make the switch? Be my guest, baby
I'm feelin' all my fuckin' feelings
