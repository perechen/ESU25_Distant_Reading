Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
Choose your last words
This is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die

[Chorus]
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
So, choose your last words
This is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die

[Drop]
(We were born to die)

[Chorus]
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
So, choose your last words
This is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die



[Bridge]
I was so confused as a little child
Tried to take what I could get
Scared that I couldn't find
All the answers I need

Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough I don't know why

Keep making me laugh
Let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

[Chorus]
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
So, choose your last words
This is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die

[Drop]
(We were born to die)

[Chorus]
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
So, choose your last words
This is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die
