I went to Paris (Texas)
With a suitcase in my hand
I had to leave
Knew they wouldn't understand

[Chorus]
When you know, you know
When you know, you know
It's time, it's time to go
When you know, you know
Then the more you know
It's time to go

[Verse 2]
I took a train to Spain
Just a notebook in my hand
Then I went to see some friends of mine
Down in Florence, Alabama

[Chorus]
When you know, you know
When you know, you know
It's time, it's time to go
When you know, you know
That it's time to leave
Like the summer breeze



[Bridge]
When everyone's star is bright
Brighter than you are
It's time to go
And you're the only one left
Dancin' while they're on the floor
Time to go

[Verse 3]
I flew back home
It seems everything's the same (Venice, California)
Except that you weren't home
“Hello,” I call to no one (But)

[Outro]
When you're home, you're home (Venice, California)
When you're home, you're home (Venice, California)
You're home, when you're alone
When you're right, you're right
When you're right, you're right
Even when you're wrong
