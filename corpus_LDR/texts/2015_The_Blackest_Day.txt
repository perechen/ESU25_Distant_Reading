Carry me home, got my blue nail polish on
It's my favorite color and my favorite tone of song
"I don't really wanna break up, we got it going on"
It's what you gathered from my talk, but you were wrong

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It's not easy for me to talk about
I have heavy heartstrings
I'm not simple, it's trigonometry
It's hard to express
I can't explain

[Chorus]
Ever since my baby went away
It's been the blackest day
It's been the blackest day
All I hear is Billie Holiday
It's all that I play
It's all that I play

[Post-Chorus]
Because I'm going deeper and deeper (Deeper)
Harder and harder (Harder)
Getting darker and darker
Looking for love
In all the wrong places
Oh my God
In all the wrong places
Oh my God



[Verse 2]
Carry me home, got my new car and my gun
Wind in my hair, holding your hand, listenin' to our song
Carry me home, don't wanna talk about the things to come
Just put your hands up in the air, the radio on

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause there's nothing for us to talk about
Like the future and those things
'Cause there's nothing for me to think about
Now that he's gone, I can't feel nothing

[Chorus]
Ever since my baby went away
It's been the blackest day
It's been the blackest day
All I hear is Billie Holiday
It's all that I play
It's all that I play

[Post-Chorus]
Because I'm going deeper and deeper (Deeper)
Harder and harder (Harder)
Getting darker and darker
Looking for love
In all the wrong places
Oh, my God
In all the wrong places
Oh, my God



[Bridge]
You should've known better
Than to have, to let her
Get you under her spell of the weather
I got you where I want you
You're deader than ever
And falling for forever
I'm playing head games with you
Got you where I want you
I got you, I got you
I got you where I want you now

[Chorus]
Ever since my baby went away
It's been the blackest day
It's been the blackest day
And all I hear is Billie Holiday
It's all that I play
It's all that I play

[Outro]
It's not one of those phases I'm going through
Or just a song, it's not one of them
I'm on my own
On my own
On my own again
I'm on my own again
I'm on my own again
I'm on my own again
I'm on my own again
