[Verse 1]
Met my boyfriend down at the taco truck
Pass me my vape, I'm feelin' sick, I need to take a puff
Imagine if we actually gave a fuck
Wouldn't that be somethin' to talk about for us?
Caribbean Blue in sweater weather, I'm falling into you
Although it seems I've gotten better, I can be violent too

[Chorus]
Oh, that's why they call me Lanita
When I get down, I'm bonita
Don't come find me in Reseda
I'll go crazy
Read my gold chain, says "Lanita"
When I'm violent, it's Carlito's Way
Blood on my feet, on the street
I'm dancin' crazy

[Post-Chorus]
Spin it 'til you whip it into white cream, baby
Print it into black and white pages, don't faze me
Before you talk, let me stop what you're saying
I know, I know, I know that you hate me



[Spoken Outro: Margaret Qualley]
Honey, I got up so early
And then, I got into the shower
I was just able to go back to sleep for a hour and a half
So that rocked, um, anyway (Ah, ah)
I had this dream where, um, aha, I don't know

[Part II: VB]

[Intro]
(Signin' off, bang, bang, kiss, kiss)

[Verse 1]
You heard my baby's back in town now (Oh no)
You should come, come over
We'll be hanging around now
You should come, come over
Back, back to the garden
We're gettin' high now because we're older
Me, myself, I like diamonds
My baby, crimson and clover

[Chorus]
Oh God, I miss you on my lips
It's me, your little Venice Bitch
On the stoop with your neighborhood kids
Callin' out, bang, bang, kiss, kiss



[Post-Chorus]
(Ah, ah, ciao)
Calling' out, bang, bang, kiss, kiss
(Ah, yeah, ah, ciao)
Signin' off, bang, bang, kiss, kiss
(Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Back in the garden
We're gettin' high now because we're older
Me, myself, I like diamonds
My baby, crimson and clover

[Pre-Chorus]
Wha-wha-wha-wha-whatever
Everything, whatever
Wha-wha-wha-wha-whatever
Everything's whatever

[Chorus]
Oh God, I miss you on my lips (I do, I do)
It's me, your little Venice bitch (Yes, it is)
On the stoop with the neighborhood kids
Callin' out, bang, bang, kiss, kiss

[Refrain]
(Ah, ah, ciao)
Callin' out, bang, bang, kiss, kiss
(Ah, yeah, ah, ciao)
Signin' off, bang, bang, kiss, kiss
(Yeah, yeah)



[Bridge]
If you weren't mine, I'd be (Get high)
Jealous of your love (Drop acid)
If you weren't mine, I'd be (Never die)
Jealous of your love (Not tonight, Lake Placid)
If you weren't mine, I'd be
Jealous of your love (Yeah)
If you weren't mine, I'd be
Jealous of your love
If you weren't mine, I'd be (Oh, God, I miss you on my lips)
Jealous of your love (It's me, your little Venice Bitch)
If you weren't mine, I'd be (On the stoop with the neighborhood kids)
Jealous of your love (Calling out, bang bang, kiss kiss)

[Outro]
Mmm, mmm (Lake Placid)
Callin' out, bang, bang, kiss, kiss
Mmm (Jealous of your love)
Signin' off, bang, bang, kiss, kiss
Mmm (Yeah)
