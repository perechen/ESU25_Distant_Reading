PROLOGUEThe Hegemony Consul sat on the balcony of his ebony spaceship and playedRachmaninoff's Prelude in C-sharp Minor on an ancient butwell-maintained Steinway while great, green, saurian things surged andbellowed in the swamps below. A thunderstorm was brewing to the north.Bruise-black clouds silhouetted a forest of giant gymnosperms whilestratocumulus towered nine kilometers high in a violent sky. Lightningrippled along the horizon. Closer to the ship, occasional vague,reptilian shapes would blunder into the interdiction field, cry out, andthen crash away through indigo mists. The Consul concentrated on adifficult section of the Prelude and ignored the approach of storm andnightfall.The fatline receiver chimed.The Consul stopped, fingers hovering above the keyboard, and listened.Thunder rumbled through the heavy air. From the direction of thegymnosperm forest there came the mournful ululation of a carrion-breedpack. Somewhere in the darkness below, a small-brained beast trumpetedits answering challenge and fell quiet.The interdiction field added its sonic undertones to the sudden silence.The fatline chimed again.'Damn,' said the Consul and went in to answer it.While the computer took a few seconds to convert and decode the burst ofdecaying tachyons, the Consul poured himself a glass of Scotch. Hesettled into the cushions of the projection pit just as the diskeyblinked green. 'Play,' he said.'You have been chosen to return to Hyperion,' came a woman's huskyvoice. Full visuals had not yet formed; the air remained empty exceptfor the pulse of transmissioncodes which told the Consul that this fatline squirt had originated onthe Hegemony administrative world of Tau Ceti Center. The Consul didnot need the transmission coordinates to know this. The aged but stillbeautiful voice of Meina Gladstone was unmistakable.'You have been chosen to return to Hyperion as a member of the ShrikePilgrimage,' continued the voice.The hell you say, thought the Consul and rose to leave the pit.'You and six others have been selected by the Church of the Shrike andconfirmed by the All Thing,' said Meina Gladstone. 'It is in theinterest of the Hegemony that you accept."The Consul stood motionless in the pit, his back to the flickeringtransmission codes. Without turning, he raised his glass and drainedthe last of the Scotch.'The situation is very confused,' said Meina Gladstone. Her voice wasweary. 'The consulate and Home Rule Council fatlined us three standardweeks ago with the news that the Time Tombs showed signs of opening. Theanti-entropic fields around them were expanding rapidly and the Shrikehas begun ranging as far south as the Bridle Range."The Consul turned and dropped into the cushions. A hoio had formed ofMeina Gladstone's ancient face. Her eyes looked as tired as her voicesounded.'A FORCE:space task force was immediately dispatched from Parvati toevacuate the Hegemony citizens on Hyperion before the Time Tombs open.Their time-debt will be a little more than three Hyperion years." MeinaGladstone paused. The Consul thought he had never seen the Senate CEOlook so grim. 'We do not know if the evacuation fleet will arrive intime,' she said, 'but the situation is even more complicated. An Oustermigration cluster of at least four thousand... units...has been detected approaching the Hyperion system.Our evacuation task force should arrive only a short while before theOusters."The Consul understood Gladstone's hesitation. An Ouster migrationcluster might consist of ships ranging in size from single-personramscouts to can cities and comet forts holding tens of thousands of theinterstellar barbarians.'The FORCE joint chiefs believe that this is the Ousters' big push,'said Meina Gladstone. The ship's computer had positioned the holo sothat the woman's sad brown eyes seemed to be staring directly at theConsul.'Whether they seek to control just Hyperion for the Time Tombs orwhether this is an all-out attack on the Worldweb remains to be seen. Inthe meantime, a full FORCE:space battle fleet complete with a fareasterconstruction battalion has spun up from the Camn System to join theevacuation task force, but this fleet may be recalled depending uponcircumstances."The Consul nodded and absently raised the Scotch to his lips. Hefrowned at the empty glass and dropped it onto the thick carpeting ofthe holopit. Even with no military training he understood the difficulttactical decision Gladstone and the joint chiefs were faced with.Unless a military fareaster were hurriedly constructed in the Hyperionsystem- at staggering expense- there would be no way to resist theOuster invasion. Whatever secrets the Time Tombs might hold would go tothe Hegemony's enemy. If the fleet did construct a farcaster in timeand the Hegemony committed the total resources of FORCE to defending thesingle, distant, colonial world of Hyperion, the Worldweb ran theterrible risk of suffering an Ouster attack elsewhere on the perimeter,or- in a worst-case scenario- having the barbarians actually seizing thefarcaster and penetrating the Web itself. The Consul tried to imaginethe reality of armored Ouster troops stepping through farcaster portalsinto the undefended home cities on a hundred worlds.The Consul walked through the holo of Meina Gladstone, retrieved hisglass, and went to pour another Scotch.'You have been chosen to join the pilgrimage to the Shrike,' said theimage of the old CEO whom the press loved to compare to Lincoln orChurchill or Alvarez-Temp or whatever other pre-Hegira legend was inhistorical vogue at the time. 'The Templars are sending their treeshipYggdrasil!,' said Gladstone, 'and theevacuation task force commander has instructions to let it pass. With athree-week time-debt, you can rendezvous with the Yggdrasill before itgoes quantum from the Parvati system. The six other pilgrims chosen bythe Shrike Church will be aboard the treeship. Our intelligence reportssuggest that at least one of the seven pilgrims is an agent of theOusters. We do not... at this time... have any way of knowing whichone it is."The Consul had to smile. Among all the other risks Gladstone wastaking, the old woman had to consider the possibility that he was thespy and that she was fatlining crucial information to an Ouster agent.Or had she given him any crucial information? The fleet movements weredetectable as soon as the ships used their Hawking drives, and if theConsul were the spy, the CEO's revelation might be a way to scare himoff. The Consul's smile faded and he drank his Scotch.'Sol Weintraub and Fedmahn Kassad are among the seven pilgrims chosen,'said Gladstone.The Consul's frown deepened. He stared at the cloud of digitsflickering like dust motes around the old woman's image. Fifteenseconds of fatline transmission time remained.'We need your help,' said Meina Gladstone. 'It is essential that thesecrets of the Time Tombs and Shrike be uncovered. This pilgrimage maybe our last chance. If the Ousters conquer Hyperion, their agent mustbe eliminated and the Time Tombs sealed at all cost. The fate of theHegemony may depend upon it."The transmission ended except for the pulse of rendezvous coordinates.'Response?" asked the ship's computer.Despite the tremendous energies involved, the spacecraft was capable ofplacing a brief, coded squirt into the incessant babble of FTL burstswhich tied the human portions of the galaxy together.'No,' said the Consul and went outside to lean on the balcony railing.Night had fallen and the clouds were low. No stars were visible. Thedarkness would have been absolute except for the intermittent flash oflightning to the north and a soft phosphorescence rising from themarshes. The Consul was suddenly very aware that he was, at thatsecond, the only sentient being on an unnamed world. He listened to theantediluvian night sounds rising from the swamps and he thought aboutmorning, about setting out in the Vikken EMV at first light, aboutspending the day in sunshine, about hunting big game in the fern foreststo the south and then returning to the ship in the evening for a goodsteak and a cold beer. The Consul thought about the sharp pleasure ofthe hunt and the equally sharp solace of solitude: solitude he hadearned through the pain and nightmare he hadalready suffered on Hyperion.Hyperion.The Consul went inside, brought the balcony in, and sealed the ship justas the first heavy raindrops began to fall. He climbed the spiralstaircase to his sleeping cabin at the apex of the ship. The circularroom was dark except for silent explosions of lightning which outlinedrivulets of rain coursing the skylight. The Consul stripped, lay backon the firm mattress, and switched on the sound system and externalaudio pickups. He listened as the fury of the storm blended with theviolence of Wagner's 'Flight of the Valkyries." Hurricane winds buffetedthe ship. The sound of thunderclaps filled the room as the skylightflashed white, leaving afterimages burning in the Consu!'s retinas.Wagner is good only for thunderstorms, he thought.He closed his eyes but the lightning was visible through closed eyelids.He remembered the glint of ice crystals blowing through the tumbledruins on the low hills near the Time Tombs and the colder gleam of steelon the Shrike's impossible tree of metal thorns. He remembered screamsin the night and the hundred-facet, ruby and-blood gaze of the Shrikeitself.Hyperion.The Consul silently commanded the computer to shut off all speakers andraised his wrist to cover his eyes. In the sudden silence he laythinking about how insane it would be to return to Hyperion. During hiseleven years as Consul on that distant and enigmatic world, themysterious Church of the Shrike had allowed a dozen barges of offworldpilgrims to depart for the windswept barrensaround the Time Tombs, north of the mountains. No one had returned. Andthat had been in normal times, when the Shrike had been prisoner to thetides of time and forces no one understood, and the anti-entropic fieldshad been contained to a few dozen meters around the Time Tombs. Andthere had been no threat of an Ouster invasion.The Consul thought of the Shrike, free to wander everywhere on Hyperion,of the millions of indigenies and thousands of Hegemony citizenshelpless before a creature which defied physical laws and whichcommunicated only through death, and he shivered despite thewarmth of the cabin.Hyperion.The night and storm passed. Another stormfront raced ahead of theapproaching dawn. Gymnosperms two hundred meters tall bent and whippedbefore the coming torrent. Just before first light, the Consul's ebonyspaceship rose on a tail of blue plasma and punched through thickeningclouds as it climbed toward space and rendezvous.ONEThe Consul awoke with the peculiar headache, dry throat, and sense ofhaving forgotten a thousand dreams which only periods in cryogenic fuguecould bring. He blinked, sat upright on a low couch, and groggilypushed away the last sensor tapes clinging to his skin. There were twovery short crew clones and one very tall, hooded Templar with him in thewindowless ovoid of a room. One of the clones offered the Consul thetraditional post-thaw glass of orange juice. He accepted it and drankgreedily.'The Tree is two light-minutes and five hours of travel from Hyperion,'said the Templar, and the Consul realized that he was being addressed byHet Masteen, captain of the Templar treeship and True Voice of the Tree.The Consul vaguely realized that it was a great honor to be awakened bythe Captain, but he was too groggy and disoriented from fugue toappreciate it.'The others have been awake for some hours,' said Het Masteen andgestured for the clones to leave them.'They have assembled on the foremost dining platform."'Hhrghn,' said the Consul and took a drink. He cleared his throat andtried again. 'Thank you, Het Masteen,' he managed. Looking around atthe egg-shaped room with its carpet of dark grass, translucent walls,and support ribs of continuous, curved weirwood, the Consul realizedthat he must be in one of the smaller environment pods. Closing hiseyes, he tried to recall his memories of rendezvous just before theTemplar ship went quantum.The Consul remembered his first glimpse of the kilometer-long treeshipas he closed for rendezvous, the treeship's details blurred by theredundant machine anderg-generated containment fields which surrounded it like a sphericalmist, but its leafy bulk clearly ablaze with thousands of lights whichshone softly through leaves and thin-walled environment pods, or alongcountless platforms, bridges, command decks, stairways, and bowers.Around the base of the treeship, engineering and cargo spheres clusteredlike oversized galls while blue and violet drive streamers trailedbehind like ten-kilometer-long roots.'The others await,' Her Masteen said softly and nodded toward lowcushions where the Consul's luggage lay ready to open upon his command.The Templar gazed thoughtfully at the weirwood rafters while the Consuldressed in semiformal evening wear of loose black trousers, polishedship boots, a white silk blouse which ballooned at waist and elbows,topaz collar cinch, black demi-coat complete with slashes of Hegemonycrimson on the epaulets, and a soft gold tricorne. A section of curvedwall became a mirror and the Consul stared at the image there: a morethan middle-aged man in semi-formal evening wear, sunburned skin butoddly pale under the sad eyes. The Consul frowned, nodded, and turnedaway.Het Masteen gestured and the Consul followed the tall, robed figurethrough a dilation in the pod onto an ascending walkway which curved upand out of sight around the massive bark wall of the treeship's trunk.The Consul paused, moved to the edge of the walkway, and took a quickstep back. It was at least six hundred meters down- down being createdby the one-sixth standard gravity being generated by the singularitiesimprisoned at the base of the tree - and there were no railings.They resumed their silent ascent, turning off from the main trunkwalkway thirty meters and half a trunk-spiral later to cross a flimsysuspension bridge to a five-meter-wide branch. They followed thisoutward to where the riot of leaves caught the glare of Hyperion's sun.'Has my ship been brought out of storage?" asked the Consul.'It is fueled and ready in sphere eleven,' said Her Masteen. Theypassed into the shadow of the trunk and stars became visible in theblack patches between the dark latticework of leaves. 'The otherpilgrims have agreed to ferry down in your ship if the FORCE authoritiesgive permission,' added the Templar.The Consul rubbed his eyes and wished that he had been allowed more timeto retrieve his wits from the cold grip of cryonic fugue. 'You've beenin touch with the task force?"'Oh, yes, we were challenged the moment we tunneled down from quantumleap. A Hegemony warship is...escorting us..  this very moment." Het Masteen gestured toward a patchof sky above them.The Consul squinted upward but at that second segments of the uppertiers of branches revolved out of the treeship's shadow and acres ofleaves ignited in sunset hues. Even in the still shadowed places,glowbirds nestled like Japanese lanterns above lighted walkways, glowingswingvines, and illuminated hanging bridges, while fireflies from OldEarth and radiant gossamers from Maul-Covenant blinked and coded theirway through labyrinths of leaves, mixing with constellationssufficiently to fool even the most starwise traveler.Het Masteen stepped into a basket lift hanging from a whiskered-carboncable which disappeared into the three hundred meters of tree abovethem. The Consul followed and they were borne silently upward. Henoted that the walkways, pods, and platforms were conspicuously emptyexcept for a few Templars and their diminutive crew clone counterparts.The Consul could recall seeing no other passengers during his rushedhour between rendezvous and fugue, but he had put that down to theimminence of the treeship going quantum, assuming then that thepassengers were safe in their fugue couches. Now, however, the treeshipwas traveling far below relativistic velocities and its branches shouldbe crowded with gawking passengers. He mentioned his observation to theTemplar.'The six of you are our only passengers,' said Het Masteen. The basketstopped in a maze of foliage andthe treeship captain led the way up a wooden escalator worn with age.The Consul blinked in surprise. A Templar treeship normally carriedbetween two and five thousand passengers; it was easily the mostdesirable way to travel between the stars. Treeships rarely accruedmore than a four- or five-month time-debt, making short, sceniccrossings where star systems were a very few light-years apart, thusallowing their affluent passengers to spend as little time as necessaryin fugue. For the treeship to make the trip to Hyperion and back,accumulating six years of Web time with no paying passengers would meana staggering financial loss to the Templars.Then the Consul realized, belatedly, that the treeship would be idealfor the upcoming evacuation, its expenses ultimately to be reimbursed bythe Hegemony.Still, the Consul knew, to bring a ship as beautiful and vulnerable asthe Yggdrasill - one of only five of its kind - into a war zone was aterrible risk for the Templar Brotherhood.'Your fellow pilgrims,' announced Het Masteen as he and the Consulemerged onto a broad platform where a small group waited at one end of along wooden table.Above them the stars burned, rotating occasionally as the treeshipchanged its pitch or yaw, while to either side a solid sphere of foliagecurved away like the green skin of some great fruit. The Consulimmediately recognized the setting as the Captain's dining platform,even before the five other passengers rose to let Her Masteen take hisplace at the head of the table. The Consul found an empty chair waitingfor him to the left of the Captain.When everyone was seated and quiet, Het Masteen made formalintroductions. Although the Consul knew none of the others frompersonal experience, several of the names were familiar and he used hisdiplomat's long training to file away identities and impressions.To the Consul's left sat Father Lenar Hoyt, a priest of the old-styleChristian sect known as Catholic. For a second the Consul had forgottenthe significance of the black clothing and Roman collar, but then heremembered St Francis Hospital on Hebron where he hadreceived alcohol trauma therapy after his disastrous first diplomaticassignment there almost four standard decades earlier. And at themention of Hoyt's name he remembered another priest, one who haddisappeared on Hyperion halfway through his own tenure there.Lenar Hoyt was a young man by the Consul's reckoning - no more than hisearly thirties - but it appeared that something had aged the manterribly in the not too distant past. The Consul looked at the thinface, cheekbones pressing against sallow flesh, eyes large but hooded indeep hollows, thin lips set in a permanent twitch of muscle toodownturned to be called even a cynical smile, the hairline not so muchreceding as ravaged by radiation, and he felt he was looking at a manwho had been ill for years. Still, the Consul was surprised that behindthat mask of concealed pain there remained the physical echo of the boyin the man - the faintest remnants of the round face, fair skin, andsoft mouth which had belonged to a younger, healthier, less cynicalLenar Hoyt.Next to the priest sat a man whose image had been familiar to mostcitizens of the Hegemony some years before. The Consul wondered if thecollective attention span in the Worldweb was as short now as it hadbeen when he had lived there. Shorter, probably. If so, then ColonelFedmahn Kassad, the so-called Butcher of South Bressia, was probably nolonger either infamous or famous. To the Consul's generation and to allthose who lived in the slow, expatriate fringe of things, Kassad was notsomeone one was likely to forget.Colonel Fedmahn Kassad was tall- almost tall enough to look thetwo-meter Her Masteen in the eye - and dressed in FORCE black with norank insignia or citations showing. The black uniform was oddly similarto Father Hoyt's garb, but there was no real resemblance between the twomen. In lieu of Hoyt's wasted appearance, Kassad was brown, obviouslyfit, and whip-handle lean, with strands of muscle showing in shoulder,wrist, and throat. The Colone!'s eyes were small, dark, and asall-encompassing as the lenses of some primitive video camera. His facewas all angles: shadows, planes, and facets. Not gaunt like FatherHoyt's, merely carved from cold stone. A thin line of beard along hisjawline served to accent the sharpness of his countenance as surely asblood on a knife blade.The Colonel's intense, slow movements reminded the Consul of anEarth-bred jaguar he had seen in a private seedship zoo on Lusus manyyears before. Kassad's voice was soft but the Consul did not fail tonotice that even the Colone!'s silences commanded attention.Most of the long table was empty, the group clustered at one end. Acrossfrom Fedmahn Kassad sat a man introduced as the poet Martin Silenus.Silenus appeared to be quite the opposite of the military *****manacross from him. Where Kassad was lean and tall, Martin Silenus wasshort and visibly out of shape.Countering Kassad's stone-cut features, the poet's face was as mobileand expressive as an Earth primate's. His voice was a loud, profanerasp. There was something, thought the Consul, almost pleasantlydemonic about Martin Silenus, with his ruddy cheeks, broad mouth,pitched eyebrows, sharp ears, and constantly moving hands sportingfingers long enough to serve a concert pianist.Or a strangler. The poet' s silver hair had been cropped intorough-hewn bangs.Martin Silenus seemed to be in his late fifties, but the Consul noticedthe telltale blue tinge to throat and palms and suspected that the manhad been through more than a few Poulsen treatments. Silenus's true agemight be anywhere from ninetytoa hundred and fiftystandard years. I fhe were close to the latter age, the Consul knew, the odds were that thepoet was quite mad.As boisterous and animated as Martin Silenus seemed upon firstencounter, so the next guest at the table exuded an immediate andequally impressive sense of intelligent reticence. Sol Weintranb lookedup upon introduction and the Consul noted the short gray beard, linedforehead, and sad, luminous eyes of the we!i-known scholar. The Consulhad heard tales of the Wandering Jew and his hopeless quest, but he wasshocked to realize that the old man now held the infant in his arms -his daughter Rachel, no more than a few weeks old. The Consul lookedaway.The sixth pilgrim and only woman at the table was Brawne Lamia. Whenintroduced, the detective stared at the Consul with such intensity thathe could feel the pressure of her gaze even after she looked away.A former citizen of the 1.3-g world of Lusus, Brawne Lamia was no tallerthan the poet two chairs to her right, but even her loose corduroyshipsuit did not conceal the heavy layers of muscle on her compact form.Black curls reached to her shoulders, her eyebrows were two dark linesdabbed horizontally across a wide brow, and her nose was solid andsharp, intensifying the aquiline quality of her stare. Lamia's mouthwas wide and expressive to the point of being sensuous, curled slightlyat the coruers in a slight smile which might be cruel or merely playful.The woman's dark eyes seemed to dare the observer to discover which wasthe case.It occurred to the Consul that Brawne Lamia might well be consideredbeautiful.Introductions completed, the Consul cleared his throat and turned towardthe Templar. 'Het Masteen, you said that there were seven pilgrims. IsM.Weintraub's child the seventh?"Het Masteen's hood moved slowly from side to side.'No. Only those who make a conscious decision to seek the Shrike may becounted among the pilgrims."The group at the table stirred slightly. Each must know what the Consulknew; only a group comprising a prime number of pilgrims might make theShrike Church-sponsored trip north.'I am the seventh,' said Het Masteen, captain of the Templar treeshipggdrasill and the True Voice of the Tree. In the silence which followedthe announcement, Her Masteen gestured and a group of crew clones beganserving the pilgrims their last meal before planetfall.'So the Ousters are not in-system yet?" asked Brawne Lamia. Her voicehad a husky, throaty quality which strangely stirred the Consul.'No,' said Het Masteen. 'But we cannot be more than a few standard daysahead of them. Our instrumentshave detected fusion skirmishes within the system's OOrt cloud."'Will there be war."?" asked Father Hoyt. His voice seemed as fatiguedas his expression. When no one volunteered a response, the priestturned to his right as if retroactively directing the question to theConsul.The Consul sighed. The crew clones had served wine; he wished it hadbeen whiskey. 'Who knows what the Ousters will do?" he said. 'They nolonger appear to be motivated by human logic."Martin Silenus laughed loudly, spilling his wine as he gestured. 'As ifwe fucking humans were ever motivated by human logic!" He took a deepdrink, wiped his mouth, and laughed again.Brawne Lamia frowned. 'If the serious fighting starts too soon,' shesaid, 'perhaps the authorities will not allow us to land."'We will be allowed to pass,; said Her Masteen. Sunlight found its waypast folds in his cowl to fall on yellowish skin.'Saved from certain death in war to be delivered to certain death at thehands of the Shrike,' murmured Father Hoyt.'There is no death in all the Universe!" intoned Martin Silenus in avoice which the Consul felt sure could have awakened someone deep incryogenic fugue. The poet drained the last of his wine and' raised theempty goblet in an apparent toast to the stars:'No smellof death = there shall be no death, moan, moan; Moan, Cybele,moan;for t hy pernicious BabesHave changed a god into a shaking palsy.Moan, brethren, moan, for l have no strength left;Freak as the reed - weak - feeble as my voice- Oh, oh, thepain, thepainof feebleness.Moan, moan, for still l thaw...".Silenus abruptly broke off and poured more wine, belching once intothe silence which had followed his recitation.The other six looked at one another. The Consul noticed that SolWeintraub was smiling slightly until the baby in his arms stirred anddistracted him.'Well,' said Father Hoyt hesitantly, as if trying to retrieve an earlierstrand of thought, 'if the Hegemony convoy leaves and the Ousters takeHyperion, perhaps the occupation will be bloodless and they'll let us goabout our business."Colonel Fedmahn Kassad laughed softly. 'The Ousters don't want tooccupy Hyperion,' he said. 'If they take the planet they'll loot whatthey want and then do what they do best. They'll burn the cities intocharred rubble, break the rubble into smaller' pieces, and then bake thepieces until they glow. They'll melt the poles, boil the oceans, andthen use the residue to salt what's left of the continents so nothingwill ever grow there again."'Well..." began Father Hoyt and then trailed off.There was no conversation as the clones cleared the soup and saladdishes and brought on the main course.'You said that there was a Hegemony warship escorting us,' the Consulsaid to Het Masteen as they finished their roast beef and boiled skysquid.The Templar nodded and pointed. The Consul squinted but could make outnothing moving against the rotating starfield.'Here,' said Fedmahn Kassad and leaned across Father Hoyt to hand theConsul a collapsible pair of military binoculars.The Consul nodded his thanks, thumbed on the power, and scanned thepatch of sky Het Masteen had indicated. Gyroscopic crystals in thebinoculars hummed slightly as they stabilized the optics and swept thearea in a programmed search pattern. Suddenly the image froze, blurred,expanded, and steadied.The Consul c6uld not avoid an involuntary intake of breath as theHegemony ship filled the viewer. Neither the expected field-blurredseed of a solo ramscout nor the bulb of a torchship, the electronicallyoutlined image was of a matte-black attack carrier. The thing wasimpressive in the way only warships through the centuries had succeededin being. The Hegemony spinship was incongruously streamlined with itsfoursets of boom arms retracted in battle readiness, its sixty-meter commandprobe sharp as a Clovis point, and its Hawking drive and fusion blistersset far back along the launch shaft like feathers on an arrow.The Consul handed the binoculars back to Kassad without comment. If thetask force was using a full attack carrier to escort the Yggdrasili,what kind of firepower were they setting in place to meet the Ousterinvasion?'How long until we land?" askedBrawne Lamia. She had been using hercornlog to access the treeship's datasphere and obviously was frustratedwith what she had found. Or had not found.'Four hours until orbit,' murmured Het Masteen. 'A few minutes more bydropship. Our consular friend has offered his private craft to ferryyou down."'To Keats?" said Sol Weintraub. It was the first time the scholar hadspoken since dinner had been served.The Consul nodded. 'It's still the only spaceport on Hyperion set tohandle passenger vehicles,' he said.'Spaceport?" Father Hoyt sounded angry. 'I thought that we were goingstraight to the north. To the Shrike's realm."Het Mssteen patiently shook his head. 'The pilgrimage always beginsfrom the capital,' he said. 'It will take several days to reach theTime Tombs."'Several days,' snapped Brawne Lamia. 'That's absurd."'Perhaps,' agreed Het Mssteen, 'but it is the case, nonetheless."Father Hoyt looked as if something in the meal had caused himindigestion even though he had eaten almost nothing. 'Look,' he said,'couldn't we change the rules this once - I mean, given the war scareand all? And just !and near the Time Tombs or wherever and get it overwith?"The Consul shook his head. 'Spacecraft and aircraft have been trying totake the short route to the northern moors for almost four hundredyears,' he said. 'l know of none who made it."'May one inquire,' said Martin Silenus, happily raising his hand like aschoolboy, 'just what the gibbering fuck happens to these legions ofships?"Father Hoyt frowned at the poet. Fedmahn Kassad smiled slightly. SolWeintraub said, 'The Consul did not mean to suggest that the area isinaccessible. One may travel by ship or various !and routes. Nor dospacecraft and aircraft disappear. They easily land near the ruins orthe Time Tombs and just as easily return to whatever point theircomputers command. It is merely the pilots and passengers who are neverseen again." Weintraub lifted the sleeping baby from his lap and set herin an infant carrier slung around his neck.'So the tired old legend goes,' said Brawne Lamia.'What do the ship logs show?"'Nothing,' said the Consul. 'No violence. No forced entry. Nodeviation from course. No unexplained time lapses. No unusual energyemissions or depletions. No physical phenomena of any sort."'No passengers,' said Het Masteen.The Consul did a slow double take. If Het Masteen had, indeed, justattempted a joke, it was the first sign in all of the Consu!'s decadesof dealing with the Templars that one of them had shown even a nascentsense of humour. What the Consul could see of the Captain's vaguelyoriental features beneath the cowl gave no hint that a joke had beenattempted.'Marvelous melodrama,' laughed Silenus. 'A real-life, Christ-weepingSargasso of Souls and we're for it.Who orchestrates this shitpot of a plot, anyway?"'Shut up,' said Brawne Lamia. 'You're drunk, old man."The Consul sighed. The group had been together for less than a standardhour.Crew clones swept away the dishes and brought dessert trays showcasingsherbets, coffees, treeship fruit, draums, tortes, and concoctions madeof Renaissance chocolate. Martin Silenus waved away the desserts andtold the clones to bring him another bottle of wine. The Consulreflected a few seconds and then asked for a whiskey.'It occurs to me,' Sol Weintraub said as the group was finishingdessert, 'that our survival may depend upon our talking to one another."'What do you mean?" asked Brawne Lamia.Weintraub unconsciously rocked the child sleeping against his chest.'For instance, does anyone here know why he or she was chosen by theShrike Church and theAll Thing to go on this voyage?"No one spoke.'I thought not,' said Weintraub. 'Even more fascinating, is anyone herea member or follower of the Church of the Shrike7 I, for one, am a Jew,and however confused my religious notions have become these days, theydo not include the worship of an organic killing machine." Weintraubraised eyebrows and looked around the table.'1 am the True Voice of the Tree,' said Het Masteen.'While many Templars believe that the Shrike is the Avatar of punishmentfor those who do not feed from the root, I must consider this a heresynot founded in the Covenant or the writings of the Muir."To the Captain's left, the Consul shrugged. 'I am an atheist,' he said,holding the glass of whiskey to the light. '1 have never been incontact with the Shrike cult."Father Hoyt smiled without humor. 'The Catholic Church ordained me,' hesaid. 'Shrike-worship contradicts everything the Church defends."Colonel Kassad shook his head, whether in refusal to respond or toindicate that he was not a member of the Shrike Church, it was notclear.Martin Silenus made an expansive gesture. '1 was baptized a Lutheran,'he said. 'A subset which no longer exists. I helped create ZenGnosticism before any of your parents were born. i have been aCatholic, a revelationist, a neo-Marxist, an interface zealot, a BoundShaker, a satanist, a bishop in the Church of Jake's Nada, and adues-paying subscriber to the Assured Reincarnation Institute. Now, Iam happy to say, I am a simple pagan." He smiled at everyone. 'To apagan,' he concluded, 'the Shrike is a most acceptable deity."'1 ignore religions,' said Brawne Lamia. 'I do not succumb to them."'My point has been made, I believe,' said Sol Weintraub. 'None of usadmits to subscribing to the Shrike cult dogma, yet the elders of thatperceptive group have chosen us over many millions of the petitioningfaithful to visit the Time Tombs... and their fierce god... in whatmay be the last such pilgrimage."The Consul shook his head. 'Your point may be made, M. Weintraub,' hesaid, 'but I fail to see it."The scholar absently stroked his beard. 'It would seem that our reasonsfor returning to Hyperion are so compelling that even the Shrike Churchand the Hegemony probability intelligences agree that we deserve toreturn,' he said. 'Some of these reasons - mine, for instance - mayappear to be public knowledge, but I am certain that none are known intheir entirety except to the individuals at this table. I suggest thatwe share our stories in the few days remaining to us."'Why?" said Colonel Kassad. 'It would seem to serve no purpose."Weintraub smiled. 'On the. contrary, it would - at the very least -amuse us and give at least a glimpse of our fellow travelers' soulsbefore the Shrike or some other calamity distracts us. Beyond that, itmight just give us enough i .nsight to save all of our lives if we areintelligent enough to find the common thread of experience which bindsall our fates to the whim of the Shrike."Martin Silenus laughed and closed his eyes. He said:'Straddling each a dolphin's backAnd steadied by a fin,Those Innocents re-live their death,Their wounds open again. ''That's Lenista, isn't it?" said Father Hoyt. '1 studied her inseminary."'Close,' said Silenus, opening his eyes and pouring more wine. 'It'sYeats. Bugger lived five hundred years before Lenista tugged at hermother's metal teat."'Look,' said Lamia, 'what good would telling each other stories do? Whenwe meet the Shrike, we tell it what we want, one of us is granted thewish, and the others die. Correct?"'So goes the myth,' said Weintraub.'The Shrike is no myth,' said Kassad. 'Nor its steel tree."'So why bore each other with stories?" asked Brawne Lamia, spearing thelast of her chocolate cheesecake.Weintraub gently touched the back of his sleeping infant's head. 'Welive in strange times,' he said.'Because we are part of that one tenth of one tenth of one percent ofthe Hegemony's citizens who travel between the stars rather than alongthe Web, we represent odd epochs of our own recent past. I, forexample, am sixty-eight standard years old, but because of thetime-debts my travels could have incurred, I might have spread thesethreescore and eight years across well morethan a century of Hegemony history."'So?" said the woman next to him.Weintraub opened his hand in a gesture which included everyone at thetable. 'Among us we represent islands of time as well as separateoceans of perspective.Or perhaps more aptly put, each of us may hold a piece to a puzzle noone else has been able to solve since humankind first landed onHyperion." Weintraub scratched his nose. 'It is a mystery,' he said,'and to tell the truth, I am intrigued by mysteries even if this is tobe my last week of enjoying them. I would welcome some glimmer ofunderstanding but, failing that, working on the puzzle will suffice."'I agree,' said Her Masteen with no emotion. 'It had not occurred tome, but I see the wisdom of telling our tales before we confront theShrike."'But what's to keep us from lying?" asked Brawne Lamia.'Nothing." Martin Silenus grinned. 'That's the beauty of it."'We should put it to a vote,' said the Consul. He was thinking aboutMeina Gladstone's contention that one of the group was an Ouster agent.Would hearing the stories be a way of revealing the spy? The Consulsmiled at the thought of an agent so stupid.'Who decided that we are a happylittle democracy?" Colonel Kassad askeddryly.'We had better be,' said the Consul. 'To reach our individual goals,this group needs to reach the Shrike regionstogether. We require some means of making decisions." 'We could appointa leader,' said Kassad.'Piss on that,' the poet said in a pleasant tone. Others at the tablealso shook their heads.'All right,' said the Consul, 'we vote. Our first decision relates toM. Weintraub's suggestion that we tell the stories of our pastinvolvement with Hyperion."'All or nothing,' said Her Masteen. 'We each share our story or nonedoes. We will abide by the will of the majority."'Agreed,' said the Consul, suddenly curious to hear the others telltheir stories and equally sure that he wouldnever tell his own. 'Those in favor of telling our tales?" 'Yes,' saidSol Weintraub.'Yes,' said Het Masteen.'Absolutely,' said Martin Silenus. 'I wouldn't miss this little comicfarce for a month in the orgasm baths on Shote."'I vote yes also,' said the Consul, surprising himself.'Those opposed?"'Nay,' said Father Hoyt but there was no energy in his voice.'1 think it's stupid,' said Brawne Lamia.The Consul turned to Kassad. 'Colonel?" Fedmahn Kassad shrugged.' I register four yes votes, two negatives, and one abstention,' saidthe Consul. 'The ayes have it. Who wants to start?"The table was silent. Finally Martin Silenus looked up from where hehad been writing on a small pad of paper.He tore a sheet into several smaller strips. 'I've recorded numbersfrom one to seven,' he said. 'Why don't we draw lots and go in theorder we draw?"'That seems rather childish, doesn't it?" said M. Lamia.'i'm a childish fellow,' responded Silenus with hissatyr's smile 'Ambassador'-he nodded toward the Consul- 'could I borrowthat gilded pillow you're wearing for a hat?"The Consul handed over his tricorne, the folded slips were dropped in,and the hat passed around. Sol Weintraub was the first to draw, MartinSilenus the last.The Consul unfolded his slip, making sure that no one else could see it.He was number seven. Tension ebbed out of him like air out of anoverinflated balloon. It was quite possible, he reasoned, that eventswould intercede before he had to tell his story. Or the war would makeeverything academic. Or the group could lose interest in stories. Orthe king could die. Or the horse could die. Or he could teach thehorse how to talk.No more whiskey, thought the Consul.'Who's first?" asked Martin Silenus.In the brief silence, the Consul could hear leaves stirring to unfeltbreezes.'1 am,' said Father Hoyt. The priest's expression showed the samebarely submerged acceptance of pain which the Consul had seen on thefaces of terminally ill friends. Hoyt held up his slip of paper with alarge 1 clearly scrawled on it.'All right,' said Silenus. 'Start."'Now?" asked the priest.'Why not?" said the poet. The only sign that Silenus had finished atleast two bottles of wine was a slight darkening of the already ruddycheeks and a somewhat more demonic tilt to the pitched eyebrows. 'Wehave a few hours before planetfall,' he said, 'and I for one plan tosleep off the freezer fugue when we're safely down and settled among thesimple natives."'Our friend has a point,' Sol Weintraub said softly. 'If the tales areto be told, the hour after dinner each day is a civilized time to tellthem."Father Hoyt sighed and stood. 'Just a minute,' he said and left thedining platform.After some minutes had passed, Brawne Lamia said, 'Do you think he'slost his nerve?"'No,' said Lenar Hoyt, emerging from the darkness at the head of thewooden escalator which served as the main staircase '! needed these."He dropped two small, stained notebooks on the table as he took hisseat.'No fair reading stories from a primer,' said Silenus.'These are to be our own tall tales, Magus!''Shut up, damn it!" cried Hoyt. He ran a hand across his face, touchedhis chest. For the second time that night, the Consul knew that he waslooking at a seriously ill man.'I'm sorry,' said Father Hoyt. 'But if I'm to tell my .. my tale, Ihave to tell someone else's story as well.These journals belong to the man who was the reason for my coming toHyperion . . . and why I am returning today." Hoyt took a deepbreath.The Consul touched the journals. They were begrimed and charred, as ifthey had survived a fire. 'Your friend has old-fashioned tastes,' hesaid, 'if he still keeps a written journal."'Yes,' said Hoyt. 'If you're all ready, I will begin." The group at thetable nodded. Beneath the dining platform, a kilometer of treeshipdrove through the cold night with the strong pulse of a living thing.Sol Weintraub lifted his sleeping child from the infant carrier andcarefully set her on a cushioned mat on the floor near his chair. Heremoved his comlog, set it near the mat, and programmed the diskey forwhite noise. The week-old infant lay on her stomach and slept.The Consul leaned far back and found the blue and green star which wasHyperion. It seemed to grow larger even as he watched. Het Masteendrew his cowl forward until only shadows showed for his face. SolWeintraub lighted a pipe. Others accepted refills of coffee and settledback in their chairs.Martin Silenus seemed the most avid and expectant of the listeners as heleaned forward and whispered:'He seyde, "Syn I shal bigynne the game,What, welcome be the cut, a Goddes name!Now !at us ryde, and herkneth what i seye."And with that word we ryden forth oure weye;And he bigan with right a myrie cheereHis tale anon, and seyde as ye may heere. 'THE PRIEST'S TALE: 'The Man Who Cried God''Sometimes there is a thin line separating orthodox zeal from apostasy,'said Father Lenar Hoyt.So began the priest's story. Later, dictating the tale into hiscornlog, the Consul remembered it as a seamless whole, minus the pauses,hoarse voice, false starts, and small redundancies which were thetimeless failings of human speech.Lenar Hoyt had been a young priest, born, raised, and only recentlyordained on the Catholic world of Pacem, when he was given his firstoffworld assignment: he was ordered to escort the respected JesuitFather Paul Dur into quiet exile on the colony world of Hyperion.In another time, Father Paul Dur certainly would have become a bishopand perhaps a pope. Tall, thin, ascetic, with white hair receding froma noble brow and eyes too filled with the sharp edge 'of experience tohide their pain, Paul Dur was a follower of St Tellhard as well as anarchaeologist, ethnologist, and eminent Jesuit theologian. Despite thedecline of the Catholic Church into what amounted to a half-forgottencult tolerated because of its quaintness and isolation from themainstream of Hegemony life, Jesuit logic had not lost its bite. Norhad Father Dur lost his conviction that the Holy Catholic ApostolicChurch continued to be humankind's last, best hope for immortality.To Lenar Hoyt as a boy, Father Dur had been a somewhat godlike figurewhen glimpsed during his rare visits to the preseminary schools, or onthe would-be seminarian's even rarer visits to the New Vatican. Then,during the years of Hoyt's study in seminary, Dur had been on animportant Church-sponsored archaeological dig on the nearby world ofArmaghast. When the Jesuit returned, a few weeks after Hoyt'sordination, it had been under a cloud. No one outside the highestcircles of the New Vatican knew precisely what had happened, but therewere whispers of excommunication and even of a hearing before the HolyOffice of the Inquisition, dormant the four centuries since theconfusion following the death of Earth.Instead, Father Dur had asked for a posting to Hyperion, a world mostpeople knew of only because of the bizarre Shrike cult which hadoriginated there, and Father Hoyt had been chosen to accompany him. Itwould be a thankless job, traveling in a role which combined the worstaspects of apprentice, escort, and spy without even the satisfaction ofseeing a new world; Hoyt was under orders to see Father Dur down to theHyperion spaceport and then reboard the same spinship for its returnvoyage to the Worldweb. What the bishopric was offering Lenar Hoyt wastwenty months in cryogenic fugue, a few weeks of in-system travel ateither end of the voyage, and a time-debt which would return him toPacem eight years behind his former classmates in the quest for Vaticancareers and missionary postings.Bound by obedience and schooled in discipline, Lenar Hoyt acceptedwithout question.Their transport, the aging spinship HS Nadia Oleg, was a pockmarkedmetal tub with no artificial gravity of any sort when it was not underdrive, no viewports for the passengers, and no on-board recreationexcept for the stimsims piped into the datalink to keep passengers intheir hammocks and fugue couches. After awakening from fugue, thepassengers - mostly offworld workers and economy-rate tourists with afew cult mystics and would-be Shrike suicides thrown in for good measure-slept in those same hammocks and fugue couches, ate recycled food infeatureless mess decks, and generally tried to cope with spacesicknessand boredom during their twelve-day, zero-g glide from their spinoutpoint to Hyperion.Father Hoyt learned little from Father Dur during those days of forcedintimacy, nothing at all about the events on Armaghast which had sentthe senior priest into exile. The younger man had keyed his comlogimplant to seek out as much data as it could on Hyperion and, by thetime they were three days out from planet fall,Father Hoyt considered himself somewhat of an expert on the world.'There are records of Catholics coming to Hyperion but no mention of adiocese there,' said Hoyt one evening as they hung talking in theirzero-g hammocks while most of their fellow passengers lay tuned intoerotic stimsims. '1 presume you're going down to do some mission work?"'Not at all,' replied Father Dur. 'The good people of Hyperion havedone nothing to foist their religious opinions on me, so I see no reasonto offend them with my proselytizing. Actually, I hope to travel to thesouthern continent- Aquila- and then find a way inland from the city ofPort Romance. But not in the guise of a missionary. I plan to set upan ethnological research station along the Cleft."'Research?" Father Hoyt had echoed in surprise. He closed his eyes tokey his implant. Looking again at Father Dur, he said, 'That section ofthe Pinion Plateau isn't inhabited, Father. The flame forests make ittotally inaccessible most of the year."Father Dur smiled and nodded. He carried no implant and his ancientcondog had been in his luggage for the duration of the trip. 'Not quiteinaccessible,' he said softly. 'And not quite uninhabited. The Bikuralive there."'Bikura,' Father Hoyt said and closed his eyes. 'But they're just alegend,' he said at last.'Hmmm,' said Father Dur. 'Try cross-indexing through Mamet Spedling."Father Hoyt closed his eyes again. General Index told him that MametSpedling had been a minor explorer affiliated with the ShackletonInstitute on Renaissance Minor who, almost a standard century and a halfearlier, had filed a short report with the Institute in which he told ofhacking his way inland from the then newly settled Port Romance, throughswamplands which had since been reclaimed for fiberplastic plantations,passing through the flame forests during a period of rare quietude, andclimbing high enough on the Pinion Plateau to encounter the Cleft and asmall tribe of humans who fit the profile of the legendary Bikura.Spedling's brief notes hypothesized that the humans were survivors of amissing seedship colony from three centuries earlier and clearlydescribed a group suffering all of the classic retrograde culturaleffects of extreme isolation, inhreeding, and overadaptation. InSpedling's blunt words, '.  even after less than two days here it isobvious that the Bikura are too stupid, lethargic, and dull to wastetime describing." As it turned out, the flame forests then began to showsome signs of becoming active and Spedling had not wasted any more timeobserving his discovery but had rushed to reach the coast, losing fourindigenie bearers, all of his equipment and records, and his left arm tothe 'quiet' forest in the three months it took him to escape.'My God,' Father Hoyt had said as he lay in his hammock on the NadiaOleg, 'why the Bikura?"'Why not?" had been Father Dur's mild reply. 'Very little is knownabout them."'Very little is known about most of Hyperion,' said the younger priest,becoming somewhat agitated. 'What about the Time Tombs and thelegendary Shrike north of the Bridle Range on Equus?" he said. 'They'refamous!''Precisely,' said Father Dur6. 'Lenar, how many learned papers havebeen written on the Tombs and the Shrike creature? Hundreds?Thousands?" The aging priest had tamped in tobacco and now lighted hispipe: no small feat in zero-g, Hoyt observed. 'Besides,' said PaulDur6, 'even if the Shrike-thing is real, it is not human. I am partialto human beings."'Yes,' said Hoyt, ransacking his mental arsenal for potent arguments,'but the Bikura are such a small mystery. At the most you're going tofind a few dozen indigenies living in a region so cloudy and smoky and... unimportant that even the colony's own mapsats haven't noticedthem. Why choose them when there are big mysteries to study onHyperion..  like the labyrinths!' Hoyt had brightened. 'Did you knowthat Hyperion is one of the nine labyrinthine worlds, Father?"'Of course,' said Dur. A rough hemisphere of smoke expanded from himuntil air currents broke it into tendrils and tributaries. 'But thelabyrinths have their researchers and admirers throughout the Web,Lenar, and the tunnels have been there - on all nine worlds -for howlong? Half a million standard years? Closer to three quarters of amillion, I believe. Their secret will last. But how long will theBikura culture last before they're absorbed into modern colonial societyor, more likely, are simply wiped out by circumstances?"Hoyt shrugged. 'Perhaps they're already gone. It's been a long timesince Spedling's encounter with them and there haven't been any otherconfirmed reports. If they are extinct as a group, then all of yourtime-debt and labor and pain of getting there will be for nothing."'Precisely,' was all that Father Paul Dur had said and puffed calmly onhis pipe.It was in their last hour together, during the dropship ride down, thatFather Hoyt had gained the slightest glimpse into his companion'sthoughts. The limb of Hyperion had been glowing white and green andlapis above them for hours when suddenly the old dropship had cut intothe upper layers of atmosphere, flame had briefly filled the window, andthen they were flying silently some sixty kilometers above dark cloudmasses and starlit seas with the hurtling terminator of Hyperion'ssunrise rushing toward them like a spectral tidal wave of light.'Marvelous,' Paul Dur had whispered, more to himself than to his youngcompanion. 'Marvelous. It is at times like this that I have thesense... the slightest sense  . . of what a sacrifice it must havebeen for the Son of God to condescend to become the Son of Man."Hoyt had wanted to talk then, but Father Dur had continued to stare outthe window, lost in thought. Ten minutes later they had landed at KeatsInterstellar, Father Dur was soon swept into the whirlpool of customsand luggage rituals, and twenty minutes after that a thoroughlydisappointed Lenar Hoyt was rising toward space and the Nadia Oleg onceagain.'Five weeks later of my time, I returned to Pacem,' said Father Hoyt. 'Ihad mislaid eight years but for some reason my sense of loss randeeperthan that simple fact.Immediately upon my return, the bishop informed me that there had beenno word from Paul Dur during the four years of his stay on Hyperion. TheNew Vatican had spent a fortune on fatline inquiries, but neither thecolonial authorities nor the consulate in Keats had been able to locatethe missing priest."Hoyt paused to sip from his water glass and the Consul said, 'I rememberthe search. I never met Dur6, of course, but we did our best to tracehim. Theo, my aide, spent a lot of energy over the years trying tosolve the case of the missing cleric. Other than a few contra-dietoryreports of sightings in Port Romance, there was no trace of him. Andthose sightings went back to the weeks right after his arrival, yearsbefore. There were hundreds of plantations out there with no radios orcornlines, primarily because they were harvesting bootleg drugs as wellas fiberplastic. I guess we never talked to the people at the rightplantation. At least I know Father Dur's file was still open when Ileft."Father Hoyt nodded. 'I landed in Keats a month after your replacementhad taken over at the consulate. The bishop had been astonished when Ivolunteered to return. His Holiness himself granted me an audience. Iwas on Hyperion less than seven of its local months. By the time I leftto return to the Web, I had discovered the fate of Father Dur6." Hoyttapped the two stained leather books on the table. 'If I am to completethis,' he said, his voice thick, '1 must read excerpts from these."The treeship Yggdrasill had turned so the bulk of the tree had blockedthe sun. The effect was to plunge the dining platform and the curvedcanopy of leaves beneath it into night, but instead of a few thousandstars dotting the sky, as would have been the case from a planet'ssurface, literally a million suns blazed above, beside, and beneath thegroup at the table. Hyperion was a distinct sphere now, hurtlingdirectly at them like some deadly missile.'Read,' said Martin Silenus.FROM THE JOURNAL OF FATHER PAUL DURI :Day l:So begins my exile.I am somewhat at a loss as to how to date my new journal. By themonastic calendar on Pacere, it is the seventeenth day of Thomasmonth inthe Year of Our Lord 2732. By Hegemony Standard, it is October 12, 589p.c. By Hyperion reckoning, or so I am told by the wizened little clerkin the old hotel where I am staying, it is the twentyzthird day ofLycius (the last of their seven forty-day months), either 426 A.D.C.(after dropship crash!) or the hundred and twenty-eighth year of thereign of Sad King Billy, who has not reigned for at least a hundred ofthose years.To hell with it. I'll call it Day I of my exile.Exhausting day. (Strange to be tired after months of sleep, but that issaid to be a common reaction after awakening from fugue. My cells feelthe fatigue of Ihese past months of travel even if I do not rememberthem. I don't remember feeling this tired from travel when I wasyounger.)I felt bad about not getting to know young Hoyt better. He seems adecent sort, all proper catechism and bright eyes. It's no fault ofyoungsters like him that the Church is in its final days. It's justthat his brand of happy naivet6 can do nothing to arrest that slide intooblivion which the Church seems destined for.Well, my contributions have not helped either.Brilliant view of my new world as the dropship brought us down. I wasable to make out two of the three continents- Equus and Aquila. Thethird one, Ursa, was not visible.Planetfall at Keats and hours of effort getting through customs andtaking ground transit into the city. Confused images: the mountainrange to the north with its shifting, blue haze, foothills forested withorange and yellow trees, pale sky with its green-blue undercoating, thesun too small but more brilliant than Pacem's.Colors seem more vivid from a distance, dissolving and scattering as oneapproaches, like a pointi!!ist's palette.The great sculpture of Sad King Billy which I had heard so much aboutwas oddly disappointing. Seen from the highway, it looked raw andrough, a hasty sketch chiseled from the dark mountain, rather than theregal figure I had expected. It does brood over this ramshackle city ofhalf a million people in a way that the neurotic poet-king probablywould have appreciated.The town itself seems to be separated into the sprawling maze of slumsand saloons which the locals call Jacktown and Keats itself, theso-called Old City although it dates back only four centuries, allpolished stone and studied sterility. I will take the tour soon.I had scheduled a month in Keats but already I am eager to press on. Oh,Monsignor Edouard, if you could see me now. Punished but stillunrepentant. More alone than ever but strangely satisfied with my newexile. If my punishment for past excesses brought about by my zeal isto be banishment to the seventh circle of desolation, then Hyperion waswell chosen. I could forget my self-appointed mission to the distantBikura (are they real? 1 think not this night) and content myself withliving out the remainder of my years in this provincial capital on thisgodforsaken backwater world. My exile would be no less complete.Ah, Edouard, boys together, classmates together (although I was not sobrilliant nor so orthodox as you), now old men together. But now youare four years wiser and I am still the mischievous, unrepentant boy youremember. I pray that you are alive and well and praying for me.Tired. Will sleep. Tomorrow, take the tour of Keats, eat well, andarrange transport to Aquila and points south.Day $:There is a cathedral in Keats. Or, rather, there was one. It has beenabandoned for at least two standard centuries. It lies in ruins withits transept open to the green-blue skies, one of its western towersunfinished, and the other tower a skeletal framework of tumbled stoneand rusted reinforcement rods.I stumbled upon it while wandering, lost, along the banks of the HoolieRiver in the 'sparsely populated section of town where the Old Citydecays into Jacktown amid a jumble of tall warehouses which prevent evena glimpse of the ruined towers of the cathedral until one turns a corneronto a narrow cul-de-sac and there is the shell of the cathedral; itschapter house has half fallen away into the river, its facade is pockedwith remnants of the mournful, apocalyptic statuary of the post-Hegiraexpansionist period.I wandered through the latticework of shadows and fallen blocks into thenave. The bishopric on Paccm had not mentioned any history ofCatholicism on Hyperion, much less the presence of a cathedral. It isalmost inconceivable that the scattered seedship colony of fourcenturies ago could have supported a large enough congregation towarrant the presence of a bishop, much less a cathedral. Yet there itwas.I poked through the shadows of the sacristy. Dust and powdered plasterhung in the air like incense, outlining two shafts of sunlight streamingdown from narrow windows high above. I stepped out into a broader patchof sunlight and approached an altar stripped of all decoration exceptfor chips and cracks caused by falling masonry. The great cross whichhad hung on the east wall behind the altar had also fallen and now layin ceramic splinters among the heap of stones there. Without consciousthought ! stepped behind the altar, raised my arms, and began thecelebration of the Eucharist.There was no sense of parody or melodrama in this act, no symbolism orhidden intention; it was merely the automatic reaction of a priest whohad said Mass almost daily for more than forty-six years of his life andwhonow faced the prospect of never again participating in the reassuringritual of that celebration.It was with some shock that I realized I had a congregation.The old woman was kneeling in the fourth row of pews. The black of herdress and scarf blended so perfectly with the shadows there that onlythe pale oval of her face was visible, lined and ancient, floatingdisembodied in the darkness. Startled, I stopped speaking the litany ofconsecration. She was looking at me but something about her eyes, evenat a distance, instantly convinced me that she was blind. For a momentI could not speak and stood there mute, squinting in the dusty lightbathing the altar, trying to explain this spectral image to myself whileat the same time attempting to frame an explanation of my own presenceand actions.When I did find my voice and called to her- the words echoing in thegreat hall - I realized that she had moved. I could hear her feetscraping on the stone floor.There was a rasping sound and then a brief flare of light illuminatedher profile far to the right of the altar. I shielded my eyes from theshafts of sunlight and began picking my way over the detritus where thealtar railing had once stood. I called to her again, offeredreassurances, and told her not to be afraid, even though it was I whohad chills coursing up my back. I moved quickly but when I reached thesheltered corner of the nave she was gone. A small door led to thecrumbling chapter house and the riverbank. There was no sign of her. 1returned to the dark interior and would have gladly attributed herappearance to my imagination, a waking dream after so many months ofenforced cryogenic dreamlesshess, but for a single, tangible proof ofher presence. There in the cool darkness burned a lone red votivecandle, its tiny flame flickering to unseen drafts and currents.I am tired of this city. I am tired of its pagan pretensions and falsehistories. Hyperion is a poet's world devoid of poetry. Keats itselfis a mixture of tawdry, false classicism and mindless, boomtown energy.There are three Zen Gnostic assemblies and four High Muslim mosques inthe town, but the real housesof worship are the countless saloons and brothels, the huge marketplaceshandling the fiberplastic shipments from the south, and the Shrike Culttemples where lost souls hide their suicidal hopelessness behind ashield of shallow mysticism. The whole planet reeks of mysticismwithout revelation.To hell with it.Tomorrow I head south. There are skimmers and other aircraft on thisabsurd world but, for the Common Folk, travel between these accursedisland continents seems restricted to boat- which takes forever, I amtold- or one of the huge passenger dirigibles which de!arts from Keatsonly once a week.I leave early tomorrow by dirigible.Day 10:Animals.The firstdown team for this planet must have had a f',ation on animals.Horse, Bear, Eagle. For three days we were creeping down the east coastof Equus over an irregular coastline called the Mane. We've spent thelast day making the crossing of a short span of the Middle Sea to alarge island called Cat Key. Today we are offloading passengers andfreight at Felix, the 'major city' of the island. From what I can seefrom the observation promenade and the mooring tower, there can't bemore than five thousand people living in that random collection ofhovels and barracks.Next the ship will make its eight-hundred-kilometer crawl down a seriesof smaller islands called the Nine Tails and then take a bold leapacross seven hundred kilometers of open sea and the equator. The nextland we see then is the northwest coast of Aquila, theso-called Beak.Animals.To call this conveyance a 'passenger dirigible' is an exercise increative semantics. It is a huge lifting device with cargo holds largeenough to carry the town of Felix out to sea and still have room forthousands of bales offiberplastic. Meanwhile, the less important cargo - we passengers -make do wherewe can. I have set up a cot near the aft loading portal.and made a rather comfortable niche for myself with my personal luggageand three large trunks of expedition gear. Near me is a family ofeight- indigenie plantation workers returning from a biannual shoppingexpedition of their own to Keats -and although I do not mind the soundor scent of their caged pigs or the squeal of their food hamsters, theincessant, confused crowing of their poor befuddled rooster is more thanI can stand some nights.Animals!Day 11:Dinner tonight in the salon above the promenade deck with CitizenHeremis Denzel, a retired professor from a small planters' college nearEndymion. He informed me that the Hyperion firstdown team had no animalfetish after all; the official names of the three continents are notEquus, Ursa, and Aquila, but Creighton, Allensen, and Lopez. He went onto say that this was in honor of three middle-level bureaucrats in theold Survey Service.Better the animal fetish!It is after dinner. I am alone on the outside promenade to watch thesunset. The walkway here is sheltered by the forward cargo modules sothe wind is little more than a salt-tinged breeze. Above me curves theorange and green skin of the dirigible. We are between islands; the seais a rich lapis shot through with verdant undertones, a reversal of skytones. A scattering of high cirrus catches the last light of Hyperion'stoo-small sun and ignites like burning coral. There is no sound exceptfor the faintest hum of the electric turbines. Three hundred metersbelow, the shadow of a huge, mantalike undersea creature keeps pace withthe dirigible. A second ago an insect or bird the size and color of ahummingbird but with gossamer wings a meter across paused five metersout to inspect me before diving toward the sea with folded wings.Edouard, 1 feel very alone tonight. !t would help if 1 knew you werealive, still wbrking in the garden, writing evenings in your study. Ithought my travels would stir my-old beliefs in St Teilhard's concept ofthe God in Whom the Christ of Evolution, the Personal, and theUniversal, the En Haut and the En.4 vant are joined, but no such renewalis forthcoming.It is growing dark. I am growing old. I feel something .. not yetremorse . .. at my sin of falsifying the evidence on the Armaghastdig. But, Edouard, Your Excellency, if the artifacts had indicated thepresence of a Christ-oriented culture there, six hundred light-yearsfrom Old Earth, almost three thousand years before man left the surfaceof the homeworld...Was it so dark a sin to interpret such ambiguous data in a way whichwould have meant the resurgence of Christianity in our life-time?Yes, it was. But not, I think, because of the sin of tampering with thedata, but the deeper sin of thinking that Christianity could be saved.The Church is dying, Edouard. And not merely our beloved branch of theHoly Tree, but all of its offshoots, vestiges and cankers.The entire Body of Christ is dying as surely as this poorly used body ofmine, Edouard. You and I knew this in Armaghast, where the blood-sunilluminated only dust and death. We knew it that cool, green summer atthe College when we took our first vows. We knew it as boys in thequiet playfields of Villefranche-sur-SaSne. We know it now.The light is gone now; I must write by the slight glow from the salonwindows a deck above. The stars lie in strange constellations. TheMiddle Sea glows at night with a greenish, unhealthy phosphorescence.There is a dark mass on the horizon to the southeast. It may be a stormor it may be the next island in the chain, the third of the nine'tails." (What mythology deals with a cat with nine tails? I know ofnone.)For the sake of the bird I saw earlier - if it was a bird - I pray thatit is an island ahead and not a storm.Day 28:I have been in Port Romance eight days and I have seen three dead men.The first was a beached corpse, a bloated, white parody of a man, thathad washed up on the mud flats beyond the mooring tower my first eveningin town.Children threw stones at it.The second man I watched being pulled from the burned wreckage of amethane-unit shop in the poor section of town near my hotel. His bodywas charred beyond recognition and shrunken by the heat, his arms andlegs pulled tight in the prizefighter posture burning victims have beenreduced to since time immemorial. I had been fasting all day and Iconfess with shame that I began to salivate when the air filled with therich, frying-fat odor of burned flesh.The third man was murdered not three meters from me. I had just emergedfrom the hotel onto the maze of mud-splattered planks that serve assidewalks in this miserable town when shots rang out and a man severalpaces ahead of me lurched as if his foot had slipped, spun toward mewith a qui=ical look on his face, and fell sideways into the mud andsewage.He had been shot three times with some sort of projectile weapon. Twoof the bullets had struck his chest, the third entered just below theleft eye.Incredibly, he was still breathing when I reached him.Without thinking about it, I removed my stole from my carrying bag,fumbled for the vial of holy water 1 had carried for so long, andproceeded to perform the sac-rameut of Extreme Unction. No one in thegathering crowd objected. The fallen man stirred once, cleared histhroat as if he were about to speak, and died. The crowd dispersed evenbefore the body was removed.The man was middle-aged, sandy-haired, and slightly overweight. Hecarried no identification, not even a universal card or comlog. Therewere six silver coins in his pocket.For some reason, I elected to stay with the body the rest of that day.The doctor was a short and cynical manwho allowed me to stay during the required autopsy. !suspect that he was starved for conversation.'This is what the whole thing's worth,' he said as he opened the poorman'd belly like a pink satchel, pulling the folds of skin and muscleback and pinning them down like tent flaps.'What thing?" I asked.'His life,' said the doctor and pulled the skin of the corpse's face upand back like a greasy mask. 'Your life.My life." The red and white stripes of overlapping muscle turned to bluebruise around the ragged hole just above the cheekbone.'There has to be more than this,' I said.The doctor looked up from his grim work with a bemused smile. 'Isthere?" he said. 'Please show me." He lifted the man's heart and seemedto weigh it in one hand. 'In the Web worlds, this'd be worth some moneyon the open market. There're those too poor to keep vat-grown, clonedparts in store, but too well off to die just for want of a heart. Butout here it's just offal."'There has to be more,' I said, although I felt little conviction. Iremembered the funeral of His Holiness Pope Urban XV shortly before Ileft Pacem. As has been the custom since pre-Heglra days, the corpsewas not embalmed. It waited in the anteroom off the main basilica to befitted for the plain wooden coffin. As I helped Edouard and MonsignorFrey place the vestments on the stiffened corpse I noticed the browningskin and slackening mouth.The doctor shrugged and finished the perfunctory autopsy. There was thebriefest of formal inquiries. No suspect was found, no motive putforward. A description of the murdered man was sent to Keats but theman himself was buried the next day in a pauper's field between the mudflats and the yellow jungle.Port Romance is a jumble of yellow, weirwood structures set on a maze ofscaffolds and planks stretching far out onto the tidal mud flats at themouth of the Kans.The river is almost two kilometers wide here where it spills out intoToschahai Bay, but only a few channels are navigable and the dredginggoes on day and night. !lie awake each night in my cheap room with the window open to thepounding of the dredge-hammer sounding like the booming of this vilecity's heart, the distant susurration of the surf its wet breathing.Tonight I listen to the city breathe and cannot help but give it theflayed face of the murdered man.The companies keep a skimmerport on the edge of town to ferry men andmatriel inland to the larger plantations, but 1 do not have enough moneyto bribe my way aboard. Rather, I could get myself aboard but cannotafford to transport my three trunks of medical and scientific gear. Iam still tempted. My service among the Bikura seems more absurd andirrational now than ever before. Only my strange need for a destinationand a certain masochistic determination to complete the terms of myself-imposed exile keep me moving upriver.There is a riverboat departing up the Kans in two days. I have bookedpassage and will move my trunks onto it tomorrow. It will not be hardto leave Port Romance behind.Day 41:The Emporotic Girandole continues its slow progress upriver. No sightof human habitation since we left Melton's Landing two days ago. Thejungle presses down to the riverbank like a solid wall now; more, italmost completely overhangs us in places where the river narrows tothirty or forty meterS. The light itself is yellow, rich as liquidbutter, filtered as it is through foliage and fronds eighty meters abovethe brown surface of the Kans. I sit on the rusted tin roof of thecenter passenger barge and strain to make out my first glimpse of atesla tree. Old Kady sitting nearby pauses in his whittling, spits overthe side through a gap in his teeth, and laughs at me. 'Ain't going tobe no flame trees this far down,' he says. 'If they was the forest sureall hell wouldn't look like this. You got to get up in the Pinionsbefore you see a tesla. We ain't out of the rain forest yet, Padre."It rains every afternoon. Actually, rain is too gentle a term for thedeluge that strikes us each day, obscuring the shore, pounding the tinroofs of the barges with a deafening roar, and slowing our upstreamcrawl until it seems we are standing still. It is ns if the riverbecomes a vertical torrent each afternoon, a waterfall which the shipmust climb if we are to go on.The Oirandole is an ancient, flat-bottomed tow with five barges lashedaround it like ragged children clinging to their tired motheris skins.Three of the two-level barges carry bales of goods to be traded or soldat the few plantations and settlements along the river. The other twooffer a simulacrum of lodging for the indigenies traveling upriver,although I suspect that some of the barge's residents are permanent. Myown berth boasts a stained mattress on the floor and lizard-like insectson the walls.After the rains everyone gathers on the decks to watch the evening mistsrise from the cooling river. The air 'is very hot and supersaturatedwith moisture most of the day now. Old Kady tells me that I have cometoo late to make the climb through the rain and flame forests before thetesla trees become active. We shall see.Tonight the mists rise like the spirits of all the dead who sleepbeneath the river's dark surface. The last tattered remnants of theafternoon's cloud cover dissipate through the treetops and color returnsto the world. I watch ns the dense forest shifts from chrome yellow toa translucent saffron and then slowly fades through ocher to umber togloom. Aboard the Girandole, Old Kady lights the lanterns andcandle-globes hanging from the sagging second tier and, as if not to beoutdone, the darkened jungle begins to glow with the faintphosphorescence of decay while glowbirds and multihued gossamers can beseen floating from branch to branch in the darker upper regions.Hyperion's small moon is not visible tonight but this world movesthrough more debris than is common for a planet so close to its sun andthe night skies are illuminated by frequent meteor showers. Tonight theheavens are especially fertile and when we move onto wide sections ofthe river we can see a tracery of brilliant meteor trails weaving thestars together. Their images burn the retina after a while and I lookdown at the river only to see the same optic echo there in the darkwaters.There is a bright glow on the eastern horizon and Old Kady tells me thatthis is from the orbital mirrors which give light to a few of the largerplantations.It is too warm to return to my cabin. I spread my thin mat on therooftop of my barge and watch the celestial light show while clusters ofindigenie families sing haunting songs in an argot I have. not eventried to learn. I wonder about the Bikura, still far away from here,and a strange anxiety rises in me.Somewhere in the forest an animal screams with the voice of a frightenedwoman.Day60:Arrived Perecebo Plantation. Sick.Day 62:Very ill. Fever, fits of shaking. All yesterday ! was vomiting blackbile. The rain is deafening. At night the clouds are !it from above byorbital mirrors. The sky seems to be on fire. My fever is very high.A woman takes care of me. Bathes me. Too sick to be ashamed. Her hairis darker than most indigenies'. She says little. Dark, gentle eyes.Oh, God, to be sick so far from home.Daysheis waiting spying comesin from the rain the thin shirton purpose to tempt me, knows what iam my skin burning on fire thincotton nipples dark against it iknowwho they are they are watching, here hear their voices at night theybathe me in poison burns me they think I dont know but i hear theirvoices above the rain when the screaming stops stop stopMy skin is almost gone. red underneath can feel the hole in my cheek.when I find the bullet iwill spit it out it out.agnusdeiquitolispecattamundi miserer nobis misere nobis miserereDay 65:Thank you, dear Lord, for deliverance from illness.Day 66:Shaved today. Was able to make it to the shower.Semfa helped me prepare for the administrator's visit. I expected himto be one of the large, gruff types I've seen out the window working inthe sorting compound, but he was a quiet black man with a slight lisp.He was most helpful. I had been concerned about paying for my medicalcare but he reassured me that there would be no charge. Even better -he will assign a man to lead me into the high country! He says it islate in the season but if I can travel in ten days we should be able tomake it through the flame forest to the Cleft before the tesla trees arefully active.After he left I sat and talked to Semfa a bit. Her husband died herethree local months ago in a harvesting accident. Semfa herself had comefrom Port Romance; her marriage to Mikel had been a salvation for herand she has chosen to stay on here doing odd jobs rather than go backdownriver. I do not blame her.After a massage, I will sleep. Many dreams about my mother recently.Ten days. I will be ready in ten days.Day 75:Before leaving with Tuk, I went down to the matrix paddies to saygoodbye to Semfa. She said little but 1 could see in her eyes that shewas sad to see me go.Without premeditation, I blessed her and then kissed her on theforehead. Tuk stood nearby, smiling and bobbing. Then we were off,leading the two packbrids.Supervisor Orlandi came to the end of the road and waved as we enteredthe narrow lane hacked into theaureate foliage.Domine, dirige nos.Day 82:After a week on the trail - what trail? - after a week in thetrackless, yellow rain forest, after a week of exhausting climb up theever steeper shoulder of the.Pinion Plateau, we emerged this morning onto a rocky outcropping thatallowed us a view back across an expanse of jungle toward the Beak andthe Middle Sea.The plateau here is almost three thousand meters above sea level and theview was impressive. Heavy rain clouds spread out below us to the footof the Pinion Hills, but through gaps in the white and gray carpet ofcloud we caught glimpses of the Kans in its leisurely uncoiling towardPort R. and the sea, chrome-yellow swatches of the forest we hadstruggled through, and a hint of magenta far to the east that Tuk sworewas the lower matrix of fiberplastic fields near Perecebo.We continued onward and upward late into the evening.Tuk is obviously worried that we will be caught in the flame forestswhen the tesla trees become active. I struggle to .keep up, tugging atthe heavily laden 'brid and saying silent prayers to keep my mind off myaches, pains, and general misgivings.Day 83:Loaded and moving before dawn today. The air smells of smoke and ashes.The change in vegetation here on the Plateau is startling.No longer evident are the ubiquitous weirwood and leafy chalma. Afterpassing through an intermediate zone of short evergreens and everblues,then after climbing again through dense strands of mutated lodgepolepines and triaspen, we came into the flame forest proper with its grovesof tall prometheus, trailers of ever present phoenix, and round standsof amber !ambents. Occasionally we encountered impenetrable breaks ofthe white-fibrous, bifurcated bestos plants that Tuk picturesquelyreferred to as '... looking like de rotting cocks o' some dead giantswhat be buried shallow here, dat be sure." My guide has a way withwords.It was late afternoon before we saw our first tesla tree. For half anhour we had been trudging over an ash-covered forest floor, trying notto tread on the tender shoots of phoenix and firewhip gamely pushing upthrough the sooty soil, when suddenly Tuk stopped and pointed.The tesla tree, still half a kilometer away, stood at least a hundredmeters tall, half again as high as the tallest prometheus. Near itscrown it bulged with the distinctive onion-shaped dome of itsaccumulator gall.The radial branches above the gall trailed dozens of nimbus vines, eachlooking silver and metallic against the clear green and lapis sky. Thewhole thing made me think of some elegant High Muslim mosque on NewMecca irreverently garlanded with tinsel.'We got to get de 'brids and our asses de hell out o' here,' gruntedTuk. He insisted that we change into flame forest gear right then andthere. We spent the rest of the afternoon and evening trudging on inour osmosis masks and thick, rubber-soled boots, sweating under layersof leathery gamma-cloth. Both of the 'brids acted nervous, their longears pricking at the slightest sound. Even through my mask i couldsmell the ozone; it reminded me of electric trains I had played with asa child oj lazy Christmas Day afternoons in Vi!!efranche-sur-Sa6ne.We are camping as close as we can to a bestos break this night. Tukshowed me how to set out the ring of arrestor rods, all the timeclucking dire warnings to himself and searching the evening sky forclouds.I plan to sleep well in spite of everything.Day 84:0400 hours- Sweet Mother of Christ.For three hours we have been caught up in the middle of the end of theworld.The explosions started shortly after midnight, mere lightning crashes atfirst, and against our better judgment Tuk and I slid our heads throughthe tent flap to watch the pyrotechnics. I am used to the Matthew-monthmonsoon storms on Pacem, so the first hour of lightning displays did notseem too unusual. Only the sight of distant tesla trees as the unerringfocus of the aerial discharge was a bit unnerving. But soon the forestbehemoths were glowing and spitting with their own accumulated energyand then - just as I was drifting off to sleep despite the continuednoise - true Armageddon was unleashed.At least a hundred arcs of electricity must have been released in thefirst ten seconds of the tesla trees' opening spasms of violent energy.A prometheus less than thirty meters from us exploded, dropping flamingbrands fifty meters to the forest floor. The arrestor rods glowed,hissed, and deflected arc after arc of blue-white death over and aroundour small campsite. Tuk screamed something but no mere human sound wasaudible over the onslaught of light and noise. A patch of trailingphoenix burst into flame near the tethered 'brids and one of theterrified animals - hobbled and blindfolded as it was - broke free andlunged through the circle of glowing arrestor rods. Instantly half adozen bolts of lightning from the nearest tesla arced to the haplessanimal. For a mad second l could have sworn !saw the beast's skeleton glowing through boiling flesh and then itspasreed high into the air and simply ceased to be.For three hours we have watched the end of the world.Two of the arrestor rods have fallen but the other eight continue tofunction. Tuk and I huddle in the hot cave of our tent, osmosis masksfiltering enough cool oxygen out of the superheated, smoky air to allowus to breathe. Only the lack of undergrowth and Tuk's skill in placingour tent away from other targets and near the sheltering bestos plantshave allowed us to survive. That and the eight whiskered-alloy rodsthat stand between us and eternity.'They seem to be holding up well!" I shout to Tuk over the hiss andcrackle, crash and split of the storm.'Dey be made to stand de hour, mebbe two,' grunts my guide. 'Any time,mebbe sooner, dey fuse, we die."I nod and sip at lukewarm water through the slipstrip of my osmosismask. If I survive this night, I shall always thank God for Hisgenerosity in allowing me to see this sight.Day 8 7:Tuk and I emerged from the smoldering northeastern edge of the flameforest at noon yesterday, promptly set up camp by the edge of a smallstream, and slept for eighteen hours straight; making up for threenights of no sleep and two grueling days moving without rest through anightmare of flame and ash. Everywhere we looked as we approached thehogback ridge that marked the terminus of the forest, we could seeseedpods and cones burst open with new life for the various fire speciesthat had died in the conflagration of the previous two nights. Five ofour arrestor rods still functioned, although neither Tuk nor l was eagerto test them another night. Our surviving packbrid collapsed and diedthe instant the heavy load was lifted off its back.I awoke this morning at dawn to the sound of running water. I followedthe small stream a kilometer to the northeast, following a deepening inits sound, until suddenly it dropped from sight.The Cleft! I had almost forgotten our destination.This morning, stumbling through the fog, leaping from one wet rock toanother alongside the widening stream, I took a leap to a final boulder,teetered there, regained my balance, and looked straight down above awaterfall that dropped almost three thousand meters to mist, rock, andriver far below.The Cleft was not carved out of the rising plateau as was the legendaryGrand Canyon on Old Earth or World Crack on Hebron. In spite of itsactive oceans and seemingly earthlike continents, Hyperion istectonically quite dead; more like Mars, Lusus, or Armaghast in itstotal lack of continental drift. And like Mars and Lusus, HYperion isafflicted with its Deep Ice Ages, although here the periodicity isspread to thirty-seven million years by the long ellipse of thecurrently absent binary dwarf. The comlog compares the Cleft to thepre-tCrraformed Mariner Valley on Mars, both being caused by theweakening of crust through periodic freeze and thaw over the aeons,followed by the flow of subterranean rivers such as the Kans. Then themassive collapse, running like a long scar through the moun-tainons wingof the continent Aquila.Tuk joined me as I stood on the edge of the Cleft. 1 was naked, rinsingthe ash smell from my traveling clothes and cassock. I splashed coldwater over my pale flesh and laughed out loud as the echoes of Tuk'sshouts came back from the North Wall two thirds of a kilometer away.Because of the nature of the crust collapse, Tuk and I stood far out onan overhang that hid the South Wall below us. Although perilouslyexposed, we assumed that the rocky cornice which had defied gravity formillions of years would last a few more hours as we bathed, relaxed,shouted echoing hallos until we were hoarse, and generally acted likechildren liberated from school. Tuk confessed that he had neverpenetrated the full width of the flame forest- nor known anyone who hadin this season - and announced that, now that the tesla trees werebecoming fullydozen bolts of lightning from the nearest tesla arced to the haplessanimal.

I splashed coldwater over my pale flesh and laughed out loud as the echoes of Tuk'sshouts came back from the North Wall two thirds of a kilometer away.Because of the nature of the crust collapse, Tuk and I stood far out onan overhang that hid the South Wall below us.

Tuk confessed that he had neverpenetrated the full width of the flame forest- nor known anyone who hadin this season - and announced that, now that the tesla trees werebecoming fullyactive, he would have at least a three-month wait until he could return.He did not seem too sorry and I was glad to have him with me.In the afternoon we transported my gear in relays, setting up camp nearthe stream a hundred meters back from the cornice and stacking myflowfoam boxes of scientific gear for further sorting in the morning.It was cold this evening. After dinner, just before sunset, I pulled onmy thermal jacket and walked alone to a rocky ledge southwest of where Ihad first encountered the Cleft. From my vantage point far out over theriver, the view was memorable. Mists rose from unseen waterfallstumbling to the river far below, spray rising in shifting curtains ofmist to multiply the setting sun into a dozen violet spheres and twicethat many rainbows.I watched as each spectrum was born, rose toward the darkening dome ofsky, and died. As the cooling air settled into the cracks and cavernsof the plateau and the warm air rushed skyward, pulling leaves, twigs,and mist upward in a vertical gale, a sound ebbed up out of the Cleft asif the continent itself was calling with the voices of stone giants,gigantic bamboo flutes, church organs the size of palaces, the clear,perfect notes ranging from the shrillest soprano to the deepest bass. Ispeculated on wind vectors against the fluted rock wails, on caverns farbelow venting deep cracks in the motionless crust, and on the illusionof human voices that random harmonics can generate. But in the end lset aside speculation and simply listened as the Cleft sang its farewellhymn to the sun.I walked back to our tent and its circle of biolumi-nescent lanternlight as the first fusillade of meteor showers burned the skies overheadand distant explosions from the flame forests rippled along the southernand western horizons like cannon fire from some ancient war onpre-Hegira Old Earth.Once in the tent I try the long-range comlog bands but there is nothingbut static. I suspect that even if the primitive comsats that serve thefiberplastic plantations were ever to broadcast this far east, anythingbut the tightest laser or fatline beams would be masked by the mountainsand tesla activity. On Pacem, few of us at the monastery wore orcarried personal comlogs, but the datasphere was always there if weneeded to tap into it. Here there is no choice.I sit and listen to the last notes from the canyon wind die, watch theskies simultaneously darken and blaze, smile at the sound of Tuk'ssnoring from his bedroll outside the tent, and I think to myself, Ifthis is exile, so belt.Day 88:Tuk is dead. Murdered.I found his body when I left the tent at sunrise. He had been sleepingoutside, not more than four meters from me. He had said that he wishedto sleep under the stars.The murderers cut his throat while he slept. I heard no cry. I diddream, however: dreams of Semfa ministering to me during my fever.Dreams of cool hands touching my neck and chest, touching the crucifix 1have worn since childhood. I stood over Tuk's body, staring at thewide, dark circle where his blood had soaked into Hyperion's uncaringsoil, and I shivered at the thought that the dream had been more than adream - that hands had touched me in the night.I confess that I reacted more like a frightened old fool than as apriest. I did administer Extreme Unction, but then the panic struck meand I left my poor guide's body, desperately searched through thesupplies for a weapon, and took away the machete I had used in the rainforest and the low-voltage maser with which I had planned to hunt smallgame. Whether I would have used a weapon on a human being, even to savemy own life, I do not know. But, in my panic, I carried the machete,the maser, and the powered binoculars to a high boulder near the Cleftand searched the region for any signs of the murderers. Nothing stirredexcept the tiny arboreais and gossamers we had seen flitting through thetrees yesterday. The forest itself seemedabnormally thick and dark. The Cleft offered a hundred terraces,ledges, and rock balconies to the northeast for entire bands of savages.An army could have hidden there in the crags and ever present mists.After-thirty minutes of fruitless vigilance and foolish cowardice, Ireturned to the campsite and prepared Tuk's body for burial. It took mewell over two hours to dig a proper grave in the rocky soil of theplateau.When it was filled and the formal service was finished, I could think ofnothing personal to say about the rough, funny little man who had beenmy guide. 'Watch over him, Lord,' I said at last, disgusted at my ownhypocrisy, sure in my heart that I was mouthing words only to myself.'Give him safe passage. Amen."This evening 1 have moved my camp half a kilometer north. My tent ispitched in an open area ten meters away but I am wedged with my backagainst the boulder, sleeping robes pulled around, the machete and masernearby. After Tuk's funeral I went through the supplies and boxes ofequipment. Nothing had been taken except for the few remaining'arrestor rods.Immediately I wondered if someone had followed us through the flameforest in order to kill Tuk and strand me here, but I could think of nomotive for such an elaborate action. Anyone from the plantations couldhave killed us as we slept in the rain forest or - better yet from amurderer's point of view - deep in the flame forest where no one wouldwonder at two charred corpses. That left the Bikura. My primitivecharges.I considered returning through the flame forest without the rods butsoon abandoned the idea. It is probable death to stay and certain deathto go.Three months before the teslas become dormant. One hundred twenty ofthe twenty-six-hour local days. An eternity.Dear Christ, why has this come to me.9 And why was I spared last nightif I am merely to be offered up this night... or next?I sit here under the darkening crag and I listen to the suddenly ominousmoaning rising with the night windfrom the Cleft and I pray as the sky lights with the blood-red streaksof meteor trails.Mouthing words to myself.Day 9.5:The terrors of the past week have largely abated. I find that even fearfades and becomes commonplace after days of anticlimax.I used the machete to cut small trees for a lean-to, covering the roofand side with gamma-cloth and caulking between the logs with mud. Theback wall is the solid stone of the boulder. I have sorted through myresearch gear and set some of it out, although I suspect that I willnever use it now.I have begun foraging to supplement my quickly diminishing cache offreeze-dried food. By now, according to the absurd schedule drawn up solong ago on Pacem, I was to have been living with the Bikura for someweeks and trading small goods for local food. No matter. Besides mydiet of bland but easily boiled chalma roots, I have found half a dozenvarieties of berries and larger fruits that the comlog assures me areedible; so far only one has disagreed with me enough to keep mesquatting all night near the edge of the nearest ravine.I pace the confines of the region as restlessly as one of those cagedpelops that were so prized by the minor padishahs on Armaghast. Akilometer to the south and four to the west, the flame forests are infull form. In the morning, smoke vies with the shifting curtains ofmist to hide the sky. Only the near-solid breaks of bestos, the rockysoil here on the summit plateau, and the hogback ridges running likearmor-plated vertebrae northeast from here keep the teslas at bay.To the north, the plateau widens out and the undergrowth becomes densernear the Cleft for some fifteen kilometers until the way is blocked by aravine a third as deep and half as wide as the Cleft itself. Yesterday1 reached this northernmost point and stared across thegaping barrier with some frustration. I will try again someday,detouring to the east to find a crossing point, but from the telltalesigns of phoenix across the chasm and the pall of smoke along thenortheastern horizon, I suspect I will find only the chalma-fi!ledcanyons and steppes of flame forest that are roughed in on the orbitalsurvey map 1 carry.Tonight I visited Tuk's rocky grave as the evening wind began to wailits aeolian dirge. I knelt there and tried to pray but nothing came.Edouard, nothing came. I am as empty as those fake sarcophagi that youand I unearthed by the score from the sterile desert sands near Tarumbel Wadi.The Zen Gnostics would say that this emptiness is a good sign; that itpresages openness to a new level ofawareness, new insights, new experience.Merde.My emptiness is only... emptiness.I have found the Bikura. Or, rather, they have found me. I will writewhat I can before they come to rouse me from my 'sleep."Today I was doing some detail mapping a mere four kilometers north ofcamp when the mists lifted in the midday warmth and I noticed a seriesof terraces on my side of the Cleft that had been hidden until then. 1was using my powered glasses to inspect the terraces - actually a seriesof !addered ledges, spires, shelves, and tussocks extending far out ontothe overhang - when i realized that I was staring at man-madehabitations.The dozen or so huts were crude- rough hovels of heaped chalma fronds,stones, and spongeturf- but they were unmistakably of human origin.I was standing there irresolute, binoculars still lifted, trying todecide whether to climb down to the exposed ledges and confront theinhabitants or to retreat to my camp, when I felt that lifting chillalong the back and neck that tells one with absolute certainty that heis nolonger alone. 1. lowered the binoculars and turned slowly. The Bikurawere there, at least thirty of them, standing in a semi-circle that leftme no retreat to the forest.I do not know what I expected; naked savages, perhaps, with fierceexpressions and necklaces of teeth.Perhaps I had half expected to find the kind of bearded, wild-hairedhermits that travelers sometimes encountered in the Mosh6 Mountains onHebron. Whatever 1 had held in mind, the reality of the Bikura did notfit the template.The people who had approached me so silently were short - none camehigher than my shoulder - and swathed in roughly woven dark robes thatcovered them from neck to toe. When they moved, as some did now, theyseemed to glide over the rough ground like wraiths.From a distance, their appearance reminded me of nothing so much as agaggle of diminutive Jesuits at a New Vatican enclave.I almost giggled then, but realized that such a response might well be asign of rising panic. The Bikura showed no outward signs of aggressionto cause such a panic; they carried no weapons, their small hands wereempty. As empty as their expressions.Their physiognomy is hard to describe succinctly.They are bald. All of them. That baldness, the absence of any facialhair, and the loose robes that fell in a straight line to the ground,all conspired to make it very difficult to tell the men from the women.The group now confronting me- more than fifty by this time - looked tobe all of roughly the same age: somewhere between forty and fiftystandard years. Their faces were smooth, the skin tinged with ayellowish cast that I guessed might be associated with generations ofingesting trace minerals in the chalma and other local plant life.One might be tempted to describe the round faces of the Bikura ascherubic until, upon closer inspection, that impression of sweetnessfades and is replaced by another interpretation- placid idiocy. As apriest, I have spent enough time on backward worlds to see theeffects of an ancient genetic disorder variously called Down's syndrome,mongolism, or generation-ship legacy. This, then, was the overallimpression created by the sixty or so dark-robed little people who hadapproached me - I was being greeted by a silent, smiling band of bald,retarded children.I reminded myself that these were almost certainly the same group of'smiling children' who had slit Tuk's throat while he slept and left himto die like a butchered pig.The closest Bikura stepped forward, stopped five paces from me, and saidsomething in a soft monotone.'Just a minute,' I said and fumbled out my cornlog. I tapped in thetranslator function.'Beyetet ota menna !or cresfem ket?" asked the short man in front of me.I slipped on the hearplug just in time to hear the comlng's translation.There was no lag time. The apparently foreign.language was a simplecorruption of archaic seedship English not so far removed from theindigene argot of the plantations. 'You are the man who belongs to thecross shape/cruciform,' interpreted the cornlog, giving me two choicesfor the final noun.'Yes,' I said, knowing now that these were the ones who had touched methe night I slept through Tuk's murder. Which meant that these were theones who had murdered Tuk.! waited. The hunting maser was in my pack. The pack was set againsta small chalma not ten paces from me. Half a dozen Bikura stood betweenme and it. It did not matter. I knew at that instant that I would notuse a weapon against another human being, even a human being who hadmurdered my guide and might well be planning to murder me at any second.I closed my eyes and said a silent Act of Contrition. When 1 opened myeyes, more of the Bikura had arrived.. There was a cessation ofmovement, as if a quorum had been filled, a decision reached.'Yes,' I said again into the silence, '1 am the one who wears thecross." I heard the cornlog speaker pronounce the last word 'cresfem."The Bikura nodded in unison and - as if from long practice as altarboys- all went to one knee, robes rustling softly, in a perfectgenuflection.I opened my mouth to speak and found that I had nothing to say. 1closed my mouth.The Bikura stood. A breeze moved the brittle chalma fronds and leavestogether to make a dry, end-of-summer sound above us. The Bikuranearest to me on the left stepped closer, grasped my forearm with atouch of cool, strong fingers, and spoke a soft sentence that my comlogtranslated as, 'Come. It is time to go to the houses and sleep."It was midafternoon. Wondering if the comlog had translated the word'sleep' properly or if it might be an idiom or metaphor for 'die,' Inodded and followed them toward the village at the edge of the Cleft.Now I sit in the hut and wait. There are rustling sounds. Someone elseis awake now. 1 sit and wait.Day 97:The Bikura call themselves the 'Three Score and Ten."I have spent the past twenty-six hours talking to them, observing,making notes when they take their two-hour, midafternoon 'sleep,' andgenerally trying to record as much data as I can before they decide toslit my throat.Except now I am beginning to believe that they will not hurt me.I spoke to them yesterday after our 'sleep." Sometimes they do notrespond to questions and when they do the responses are little betterthan the grunts or divergent answers one receives from slow children.After their initial question and invitation at our first encounter, noneof them originated a single query or comment my way.! questioned them subtly, carefully, cautiously, and with theprofessional calm of a trained ethnologist. 1 asked the simplest, mostfactual questions possible tomake sure that the'comlog was functioning properly. It was. But thesum total of the answers left me almost as ignorant as I had beentwenty-some hours before.Finally, tired in body and spirit, I abandoned professional subtlety andasked the group I was sitting with, 'Did you kill my companion?"My three interlocutors did not look up from the weaving they were doingon a crude loom. 'Yes,' said the one I have come to think of as Alphabecause he had been the first to approach me in the forest, 'we cut yourcompanion's throat with sharpened stones and held him down and silentwhile he struggled. He died the true death."'Why?" I asked after a moment. My voice sounded as dry as a corn huskcrumbling.'Why did he die the true death?" said Alpha, still not looking up.'Because all of his blood ran out and he stopped breathing."'No,' I said. 'Why did you kill him?"Alpha did not respond, but Betty - who may or may not be female andAlpha's mate - looked up from herloom and said simply, 'To make him die."'Why?"The responses invariably came back and just as invariably failed toenlightened me one iota. After much questioning, I had ascertained thatthey had killed Tuk to make him die and that he had died because he hadbeen killed.'What is the difference between death and true death?" I asked, nottrusting the cornlog or my temper at this point.The third Bikura, Del, grunted a response that the comlog interpretedas, 'Your companion died the true death. You did not."Finally, in frustration far too close to rage, I snapped, 'Why not? Whydidn't you kill me?"All three stopped in the middle of their mindless weaving and looked atme. 'You cannot be killed because you cannot die,' said Alpha. 'Youcannot die because you belong to the cruciform and follow the way of thecross."I had no idea why the damn machine would translate cross as 'cross' onesecond and as 'cruciform' the next.Because you belong to the cruciform.A chill went through me, followed by the urge to laugh. Had I stumbledinto that old adventure ho10 clich - the lost tribe that worshiped the'god' that had tumbled into their jungle until the poor bastard cutshimself shaving or something, and the tribespeople, assured and a bitrelieved at the obvious mortality of their visitor, offer up theirerstwhile deity as a sacrifice?It would have been funny if the image of Tuk's bloodless face andraw-rimmed, gaping wound was not so fresh.Their reaction to the cross certainly suggested that l had encountered agroup of survivors of a once Christian colony - Catholics? - eventhough the data in the comiog insisted that the dropship of seventycolonists who had crashed on this plateau four hundred years ago hadheld only Neo-Kerwin Marxists, all of whom should have been indifferentif not openly hostile to the old religions.I considered dropping the matter as being far too dangerous to pursue,but my stupid need to know drove me on. 'Do you worship Jesus?" Iasked.Their blank expressions left no need for a verbal negative.'Christ?" I tired again. 'Jesus Christ? Christian? TheCatholic Church?"No interest.'Catholic? Jesus? Mary? St Peter? Paul? St Tellhard?"The comiog made noises but the words seemed to have no meaning for them.'You follow the cross?" I said, flailing for some last contact.All three looked at me. 'We belong to the cruciform,' said Alpha.I nodded, understanding nothing.This evening I fell asleep briefly just before sunset and when I awokeit was to the organ-pipe music of the Cleft's nightfall winds. It wasmuch louder here on thevillage ledges. Even the hovels seemed to join the chorus as the risinggusts whistled and whined through stone gaps, flapping fronds, and crudesmokeholes.Something was wrong. It took me a groggy minute to realize that thevillage was abandoned. Every hut was empty. I sat on a cold boulderand wondered if my presence had sparked some mass exodus. The windmusic had ended and meteors were beginning their nightly show throughcracks in low clouds when I heard a sound behind me and turned to findall seventy of the Three Score and Ten behind me.They walked past without a word and went to their huts. There were nolights. I imagined them sitting in their hovels, staring.I stayed outside for some time before returning to my own hut. After awhile I walked to the edge of the grassy shelf and stood where rockdropped away into the abyss. A cluster of vines and roots clung to thecliff face but appeared to end a few meters into space and hang thereabove emptiness. No vine could have been long enough to offer a way tothe river two kilometers below.But the Bikura had come from this direction.Nothing made sense. I shook my head and went back to my hut.Sitting here, writing by the light of the cornlog diskey, I try to thinkof precautions I can take to insure that I will see the sunrise.I can think of none.Day 103:The more I learn, the less 1 understand.I have moved most of my gear to the hut they leave empty for me here inthe village.I have taken photographs, recorded video and audio chips, and imaged afull holoscan of the village and its inhabitants. They do not seem tocare. I project their images and they walk right through them, showingno interest. 1 play back their words to them and they smileand go back into their hovels to sit for hours, doing nothing, sayingnothing. I offer them trade trinkets and they take them withoutcomment, check to see if they are edible, and then leave them lying. Thegrass is littered with plastic beads, mirrors, bits of colored cloth,and cheap pens.I have set up the full medical lab but to no avail; the Three Score andTen will not let me examine them, will not let me take blood samples,even though I have repeatedly shown them that it is painless, will notlet me scan them with the diagnostic equipment - will not, in short,cooperate in any way. They do not argue. They do not explain. Theysimply turn away and go about their nonbusiness.After a Week I still cannot tell the males from the females. Theirfaces remind me of those visual puzzles that shift forms as you stare;sometimes Betty's face looks undeniably female and ten seconds later thesense of gender is gone and I think of her (him?) as Beta again. Theirvoices undergo the same shift. Soft, well modulated, sexless ... theyremind me of the poorly programmed homecomps one encounters on backwardworlds.I find myself hoping to catch a glimpse of a naked Bikura. This is noteasy for a Jesuit of forty-eight standard years to admit. Still, itwould not be an easy task even for a veteran voyeur. The nudity tabooseems absolute. They wear the long robes while awake and during theirtwo-hour midday nap. They leave the village area to urinate anddefecate, and I suspect that they do not remove the loose robes eventhen. They do not seem to bathe. One would suspect that this wouldcause olfactory problems, but there is no odor about these primitivesexcept for the slight, sweet smell of chalma. 'You must undresssometimes,' I said to Alpha one day, abandoning delicacy in favor ofinformation.'No,' said AI and went elsewhere to sit and do nothing while fullydressed.They have no names. I found this incredible at first, but now I amsure.'We are all that was and will be,' said the shortestBikura, one I think of as female and call Eppie. 'We are the ThreeScore and Ten."i searched the cornlog records and confirmed what I suspected: in morethan sixteen thousand known human societies, none are listed where thereare no individual names at all. Even in the Lusus hive societies,individuals respond to their class category followed by a simple code.I tell them my name and they stare. 'Father Paul Dur, Father Paul Dur,'repeats the cornlog translator but there is no attempt at even simplerepetition.Except for their mass disappearances each day before sunset and theircommon two-hour sleep time, they do very little as a group. Even theirlodging arrangements appear random. AI will spend one naptime withBetty, the next with Gam, and the third with Zelda or Pete. No systemor schedule is apparent. Every third day the entire group of seventygoes into the forest to forage and returns with berries, chalma rootsand bark, fruit, and whatever else might be edible. I was sure theywere vegetarians until I saw Del munching on the cold corpse of aninfant arboreal. The little primate must have fallen from the highbranches. It seems then that the Three Score and Ten do not disdainmeat; they simply are too stupid to hunt and kill it.When the Bikura are thirsty they walk almost three hundred meters to astream that cascades into the Cleft.In spite of this inconvenience, there are no signs of water skins, jugs,or any type of pottery. I keep my reserve of water in ten-gallonplastic containers but the villagers take no notice. In my plummetingrespect for these people, I do not find it unlikely that they have spentgenerations in a village with no handy water source.'Who built the houses?" I ask. They have no word for viiiaBe.'The Three Score and Ten,' responds Will. I can tell him from theothers only by a broken finger that did not mend well. Each of them hasat !cast one such distinguishing feature, although sometimes I think itwould be easier to tell crows apart.'When did they build them?" I ask, although I should know by now thatany question that starts with 'when'will not receive an answer.I receive no answer.They do go into the Cleft each evening. Down the vines. On the thirdevening, I tried to observe this exodus but six of them turned me backfrom the edge and gently but persistently brought me back to my hut.It was the first observable action of the Bikura that had hinted ataggression and I sat in some apprehension after they had gone.The next evening as they departed I went quietly to my hut, not evenpeering out, but after they returned I retrieved the imager and itstripod from where I had left them near the edge. The timer had workedperfectly.The hOlos showed the Bikura grabbing the vines and scrambling down thecliff face as nimbly as the little arboreals that fill the chalma andweirwood forest.Then they disappeared under the overhang.'What do you do when you go down the cliff each evening?" I asked AI thenext day.The native looked at me with the seraphic, Buddha smile I have learnedto hate. 'You belong to the cruciform,' he said as if that answeredeverything.'Do you worship when you go down the cliff?." 1 asked.No answer.I thought a minute. 'I also follow the cross,' I said, knowing that itwould be translated as 'belong to the cruciform." Any day now I will notneed the translator program. But this conversation was too important toleave to chance. 'Does this mean that I should join you when you godown the cliff face?"For a second I thought that AI was thinking. His brow furrowed and Irealized that it was the first time that I had seen one of the ThreeScore and Ten come close to frowning. Then he said, 'You cannot. Youbelong to the cruciform but you are not of the Three Score and Ten."I realized that it had taken every neuron and synapse in his brain toframe that distinction.'What would you do if ! did go down the cliff face?" 1 asked, expectingno response. Hypothetical questions almost always had as much luck asmy time-based queries.This time he did respond. The seraphic smile and untroubled countenancereturned and Alpha said softly, 'If you try to go down the cliff we willhold you down on the grass, take sharpened stones, cut your throat, andwait until your blood stops flowing and your heart stops beating."I said nothing. I wondered if he could hear the pounding of my heart atthat moment. Well, 1 thought, at least you don't have to worry anylonger that they think you are a .god.The silence stretched. Finally AI added one more sentence that I havebeen thinking about ever since. 'And if you did it again,' he said, 'wewould have to kill you again."We stared at each other for some time after that; each convinced, I amsure, that the other was a total idiot.Day 104:Each new revelation adds to my confusion.The absence of children here has bothered me since my first day in thevillage. Looking back through my notes, 1 find frequent mention of itin the daily observations I have dictated to my comlog, but no record ofit in the personal mishmash here that I call a journal. Perhaps theimplications were too frightening.To my frequent and clumsy attempts at piercing this mystery, the ThreeScore and Ten have offered their usual enlightenment. The personquestioned smiles beatifically and responds in some non sequitur thatwould make the babble of the Web's worst village idiot seem like sageaphorisms in comparison. More often than not, they do not answer atall.One day I stood in front of the one I have tagged as Dei, stayed thereuntil he had to acknowledge my presence, and asked, 'Why are there nochildren?"'We are the Three Score and Ten,' he said softly.'Where are the babies?"No response. No sense of evading the question, merely a blank stare.i took a breath. 'Who is the youngest among you?" Del appeared to bethinking, wrestling with the concept.He was overmatched. I wondered if the Bikura had lost their time senseso completely that any such question was doomed. After a minute ofsilence, however, Del pointed to where AI was crouched in the sunlight,working with his crude hand loom, and said, 'There is the last one toreturn."'To return?" I said. 'From where?"Del stared at me with no emotion, not even impatience.'You belong to the cruciform,' he said. 'You must know the way of thecross."I nodded. I knew enough to recognize that in this direction lay one ofthe many conversational illogic-loops that usually derailed ourdialogues. I hunted for some way to keep a grasp of the thin thread ofinformation.'Then AI,' I said and pointed, 'is the last to be born. To return. Butothers will... return?"I was not sure that I understood my own question.How does one inquire about birth when the interviewee has no word forchild and no concept of time? But Del seemed to understand. He nodded.Encouraged, I asked, 'Then when will the next of the Three Score and Tenbe born? Return?"'No one can return until one dies,' he said.Suddenly I thought I understood. 'So no new children...no one will be returned until someone dies,' I said. 'You replace themissing one with another to keep the group at Three Score and Ten?"Del responded with the type of silence 1 had come to interpret asassent.The pattern seemed clear enough. The Bikura were quite serious abouttheir Three Score and Ten. They kept the tribal population at seventy -the same number recorded on the passenger list of the dropship thatcrashed here four hundred years ago. Little chance of coincidencethere. When someone died, they allowed achild .to be born to replace the adult. Simple.Simple but impossible. Nature and biology do not work that neatly.Besides the problem of minimum-herd population, there were otherabsurdities. Even though it is difficult to tell the ages of thesesmooth-skinned people, it is obvious that no more than ten yearsseparates the oldest from the youngest. Although they act likechildren, I would guess their average age to be in the late thirties ormid-forties in standard years.So where are the very old? Where are the parents, aging uncles, andunmarried aunts? At this rate, the entire tribe will enter old age atapproximately the same time.What happens when they all pass beyond childbearing age and it comestime to replace members of the tribe?The Bikura lead dull, sedentary lives. The accident rate-even whileliving on the very edge of the Cleft - must be low. There are nopredators. the seasonal variations are minimal and the food supplyalmost certainly remains stable. But, granted all this, there must havebeen times in the four-hundred-year history of this baffling group whendisease swept the village, when more than the usual number of vines gaveway and dropped citizens into the Cleft, or when something caused thatabnormal cluster of sudden deaths that insurance companies have dreadedsince time immemorial.And then what? Do they breed to make up the difference and then revertto their current sexless behavior?Are the Bikura so different from every other recorded human society thatthey have a rutting period once every few years - once a decade? - oncein a lifetime?It is doubtful.I sit here in my hut and review the possibilities. One is that thesepeople live very long lifetimes and can reproduce during most of thattime, allowing for simple replacement of tribal casualties. Only thisdoes not explain their common ages. And there is no mechanism toexplain any such longevity. The best anti-aging drugs the Hegemony hasto offer only manage to extend an active lifetime a bit over the hundredstandard-year mark. Preventive health measures have spread the vitalityof early middle age well into the late sixties - my age - but except forclonal transplants, bioengi-neering, and other perqs for the very rich,no one in the Worldweb can expect to begin planning a family when theyare seventy or expect to dance at their hundred-and-tenth birthdayparty. if eating chalma roots or breathing the pure air of the PinionPlateau had a dramatic effect on retarding aging, it would be a sure betthat everyone on Hyperion would be living here munching chalma, thatthis planet would have had a farcaster centuries ago, and that everycitizen of the Hegemony who has a universal card would be planning tospend vacations and retirement here.No, a more logical conclusion is that the Bikura live normal-lengthlives, have children at a normal rate, but kill them unless areplacement is required. They may practice abstinence or birth control-other than slaughtering the newborn- until the entire band reaches anage where new blood will soon be needed. A mass-birthing time explainsthe apparent common age of the members of the tribe.But who teaches the young? What happens to the parents and other olderpeople? Do the Bikura pass along the rudiments of their crude excusefor a culture and then allow their own deaths? Would this be a 'truedeath' - the rubbing out of an entire generation? Do the Three Scoreand Ten murder individuals at both ends of the be!l-shaped age curve?This type of speculation is useless. I am beginning to get furious atmy own lack of problem-solving skills.Let's form a strategy here and act on it, Paul. Get off your lazy,Jesuit ass.PROBLEM: How to tell the sexes apart?SOLUTION." Cajole or coerce a few of these poor devils into a medicalexam. Find out what all the sex-role mystery and nudity taboo is about.A society that depends upon years of rigid sexual abstinence forpopulation control is consistent with my new theory.PROBLEM: Why are they so fanatical about maintaining the same ThreeScore and Ten population that the lost dropship colony started with?SOLUTION: Keep pestering them until you find out.PROBLEM: Where are the children?SOLUTION: Keep pressing and poking until you find out. Perhaps theevening excursion down the cliff is related to all of this. There maybe a nursery there. Or a pile of small bones.PROBLEM: What/s this 'belong to the cruciform' and 'way of the cross'business if not a contorted vestige of the original colonists' religiousbelief?.SOLUTION: Find out by going to the source. Couldtheir daily descent down the cliff be religious in nature?PROBLEM: 'What/S down the cliff face?SOLUTION: GO down and see.Tomorrow, if their pattern holds true, all threescore and ten of theThree Score and Ten will wander into the woods for several hours offoraging. This time I will go with them.This time I am going over the edge and down the cliff.Day 105:0930 hours o Thank you, O Lord, for allowing me to see what 1 have seentoday.Thank you, O Lord, for bringing me to this place atthis time to see the proof of Your Presence.1125 hours - Edouard... Edouard!I have to return. To show you all! To show ,everyone.l've packed everything I need, putting the imager disks and film in apouch I wove from bestos leaves. I have food, water, the maser with itsweakening charge.Tent. Sleep robes.If only the arrestor rods had not been stolen!The Bikura might have kept them. No, i've searched the hovels and thenearby forest. They would have no use for them.It doesn't matter!I'll leave today if I can. Otherwise, as soon as I can.Edouard! I have it all here on the film and disks."00- There is no way through the flame forests today. The smoke droveme back even before I penetrated the edge of the active zone.I returned to the village and went over the holos.There is no mistake. The miracle is real.1530 hours- The Three Score and Ten will return any moment.What if they know... what ff they can tell by lookingat me that I have been there?I could hide.No, there is no need to hide. God did not bring me this far and let mesee what I have seen only to let medie at the hands of these poor children.1615 hours- The Three Score and Ten returned and went to their hutswithout giving me a glance.I sit here in the doorway of my own hut and cannot keep from smiling,from laughing, and from praying.Earlier I walked to the edge of the Cleft, said Mass, and tookCommunion. The villagers did not bother to watch.How soon can I leave? Supervisor Orlandi and Tuk had said that theflame forest was fully active for three local months - a hundred andtwenty days - then relatively quiet for two. Tuk and I arrived here onDay $? ....I cannot wait another hundred days to bring the news to the world... toall of the worlds.If only a skimmer would brave the weather and flame forests and pluck meout of here. If only I could access one of the datafix sats that servethe plantations.Anything is possible. More miracles will occur.2350 hours- The Three Score and Ten have gone down into the Cleft. Thevoices of the evening wind choir are rising all around.How 1 wish I could be with them now! There, below.I will do the next best thing. I will drop to my knees here near thecliff edge and pray while the organ notes of the planet and sky singwhat I now know is a hymn to a real and present God.Day i06:i awoke today to a perfect morning. The sky was a deep turquoise; thesun was a sharp, blood-red stone set within.I stood outside my hut as the mists cleared, the arboreals ended theirmorning screech concert, and the air began to warm. Then I went in andviewed my tapes and disks.I realize that in yesterday's excited scribblings I mentioned nothing ofwhat I found down the cliff. I will do so now. I have the disks,filmtapes, and comlog notes, but there is always the chance that onlythese personal journals will be found.I lowered myself over the cliff edge at approximately 0730 hoursyesterday morning. The Bikura were all foraging in the forest. Thedescent on vines had looked simple enough - they were bound around oneanother sufficiently to create a sort of ladder in most places - but asI swung out and began to let myself down, I could feel my heart poundinghard enough to be painful. There was a sheer three-thousand-meter dropto the rocks and river below. I kept a tight grip on at least two vinesat all'times and centimetered my way down, trying not to look at theabyss beneath my feet.It took me the better part of an hour to descend the hundred and fiftymeters that I am sure the Bikura can cover in ten minutes. Eventually Ireached the curve of an overhang.Some vines trailed away into space but most of them curled under thesheer slab of rock toward the cliff wall thirty meters in. Here andthere the vines 'appeared to have been braided to form crude bridgesupon which the Bikura probably walked with little or no help from theirhands. I crawled along these braided strands, clutching other vines forsupport and uttering prayers i had not said since my boyhood. I staredstraight ahead as if ! could forget that there was only a seeminglyinfinite expanse of air under those swaying, creaking strands ofvegetable matter.There was a broad ledge along the cliff wall. I allowed three meters ofit to separate me from the gulf before i squeezed through the vines anddropped two and a half meters to the stone.The ledge was about five meters wide and it terminated a short distanceto the northeast where the great mass of the overhang began. I followeda path along the ledge to the southwest and had gone twenty or thirtypaces before I stopped in shock. It was a path. A path worn out ofsolid stone. Its shiny surface had been pushed centimeters below thelevel of the surrounding rock. Farther on, where the path descended acurving lip of ledge to a lower, wider level, steps had been cut intothe stone but even these had been worn to the point that they seemed tosag in the middle.I sat down for a second as the impact of this simple fact struck me.Even four centuries of daily travel by the Three Score and Ten could notaccount for such erosion of solid rock. Someone or something had usedthis path long before the Bikura colonists crashed here.Someone or something had used this path for millennia.I stood and walked on. There was little noise except for the windblowing gently along the half-kilometer-wide Cleft. I realized that Icould hear the soft sound of the river far below.The path curved left around a section of cliff and ended. I stepped outonto a broad apron of gently descending stone and stared. I believe Imade the sign of the cross without thinking.Because this ledge ran due north and south for a hundred-meter cut ofcliff, I could look due west along a thirty-kilometer slash of Cleft toopen sky where the plateau ended. I realized at once that the settingsun would illuminate this slab of cliff wall under the overhang eachevening. It would not have surprised me if -on the spring or autumnsolstice- Hyperion's sun would, from this vantage point, appear to setdirectly into the Cleft, its red sides just touching the pink-toned rockwalls.I turned left and stared at the cliff face. The worn path led acrossthe wide ledge to doors carved into the vertical slab of stone. No,these were not merely doors, they were portals, intricately carvedportals with elaborate stone casements and lintels. To either side ofthese twin doors spread broad windows of stained glass, risingat least twenty meters toward the overhang. i went closer and inspectedthe facade. Whoever had built this had done so by widening the areaunder the overhang, slicing a sheer, smooth wail into the granite of theplateau, and then tunneling directly into the cliff face. l ran my handover the deeply cut folds of ornamental carving around the door. Smooth.Everything had been smoothed and worn and softened by time, even here,hidden away from most of the elements by the protective lip of overhang.How many thousands of years had this... temple... been carved into thesouth wail of the Cleft?The stained glass was neither glass nor plastic but some thick,translucent substance that seemed as hard as the surrounding stone tothe touch. Nor was the window a composite of panels; the colorsswirled, shaded, melded, and blended into one another like oil on water.I removed my flashlight from the pack, touched one of the doors, andhesitated as the tail portai swung inward with frictionless ease.I entered the vestibule- there is no other word for it- crossed thesilent ten-meter space, and paused in front of another wall made fromthe same stained-glass materiai that even now glowed behind me, fillingthe vestibule with thick light of a hundred subtle hues. 1 reaiizedinstantly that at the sunset hour the direct rays of the sun would fillthis room with incredibly deep shafts of color, would strike thestained-glass wail in front of me, and would illuminate whatever laybeyond.I found the single door, outlined by thin, dark metal set into thestained-glass stone, and 1 passed through it.On Pacem we have - as best we could from ancient photos and holos-rebuilt the basilica of St Peter's exactly as it stood in the ancientVatican. Almost seven hundred feet long and four hundred and fifty feetwide, the church can hold fifty thousand worshipers when His Holinesssays Mass. We have never had more than five thousand faithful thereeven when the Council of Bishops of All the Worlds is in assembly everyforty-three years. In the central apse near our copy of Bernini'sThrone of St Peter, the great dome rises more than a hundred and thirtymeters above the floor of the altar.It is an impressive space.This space was larger.In the dim light I used the beam of my flashlight to ascertain that !was in a single great room - a giant hall hollowed out of solid stone. Iestimated that the smooth walls rose to a ceiling that must be only afew meters beneath the surface of the crag where the Bikura had settheir huts. There was no ornamentation here, no furniture, no sign ofany concession to form or function except for the object that satsquarely in the center of this huge, echoing cave of a room.Centered in the great hail was an altar - a five-meter-square slab ofstone left when the rest was hollowed out - and from this altar rose across.Four meters high, three meters wide, carved in the old style of theelaborate crucifixes of Old Earth, the cross faced the stained-glasswall as if awaiting the sun and the explosion of light that would ignitethe inlaid diamonds, sapphires, blood crystals, lapis beads, queen'stears, onyxes, and other precious stones that I could make out in thelight of the flashlight as 1 approached.I knelt and prayed. Shutting off the flashlight, 1 waited severalminutes before my eyes could discern the cross in the dim, smoky light.This was, without a doubt, the cruciform of which the Bikura spoke. Andit had been set here a minimum of many thousands of years ago- perhapstens of thousands- long before mankind first left Old Earth. Almostcertainly beforeChrist taught in Galilee.I prayed.Today ! sit out in the sunlight after reviewing the holodisks. I haveconfirmed what I barely noticed during my return up the cliff afterdiscovering what I now think of as 'the basilica." On the ledge outsidethe basilica there are steps descending farther into the Cleft.Although not as worn as the path leading to the basilica, they areequally intriguing. God alone knows what other wonders wait below.I must let the worlds know of this find!The irony of my being the one tdiscover this is not lost on me. I f ithad not been for Armaghast and my exile, this discovery might havewaited more centuries. The Church might have died before thisrevelation could have brought new life to it.But I have found it.One way or the other, I will leave or get my message out.Day 107:I am a prisoner.This morning I was bathing in my usual place near where the stream dropsover the cliff edge when I heard a sound and looked up to see the BikuraI call Del staring at me with wide eyes. I called a greeting but thelittle Bikura turned and ran. It was perplexing. They rarely hurry.Then I realized that even though I had been wearing trousers at thetime, I had undoubtedly violated their nudity taboo by allowing Del tosee me naked from the waist up.I smiled, shook my head, finished dressing, and returned to the village.If I- had known what awaited me there, I would not have been amused.The entire Three Score and Ten stood watching as 1 approached. Istopped a dozen paces from Al. 'Good morning,' I said.Alpha pointed and half a dozen of the Bikura lunged toward me, seized myarms and legs, and pinned me to the ground. Beta stepped forward andremoved a sharp-edged stone from his or her robes. As I struggled invain to pull free, Beta cut my clothes down the front and pulled apartthe shreds until I was all but naked.I ceased struggling as the mob pressed forward. They stared at my pale,white body and murmured to themselves.I could feel my heart pounding. 'l am sorry if I have offended yourlaws,' I began, 'but there is no reason..."'Silence,' said Alpha and spoke to the talt Bikura with the scar on hispalm - the one I call Zed. 'He is notof the cruciform."Zed nodded.'Let me explain,' i began again, but Alpha silenced mewith a backhanded slap that left my lip bleeding and my ears ringing.There had been no more sense of hostility in his action than i wouldhave shown in silencing a comlog by throwing a switch.'What are we to do with him?" asked Alpha.'Those who do not follow the cross must die the true death,' said Betaand the crowd shifted forward. Many had sharpened stones in theirhands. 'Those not of the cruciform must die the true death,' said Betaand her voice held the tone of complacent finality common tooft-repeated formulae and religious litanies.'l follow the cross!" I cried out as the crowd tugged me to my feet. Igrabbed at the crucifix that hung around my neck and struggled againstthe pressure of many arms. Finally I managed to lift the little crossover my head.Alpha held up his hand and the crowd paused. In the sudden silence Icould hear the river three kilometers below in the Cleft. 'He doescarry a cross,' said Alpha.Del pressed forward. 'But he is not of the cruciform! I saw. It wasnot as we thought. He is not of the cruciform!" There was murder in hisvoice.I cursed myself for being careless and stupid. The future of the Churchdepended upon my survival and l had thrown both away by beguiling myselfinto believing that the Bikura were dull, harmless children.'Those who do not follow the cross must die the true death,' repeatedBeta. It was a final sentencing.Stones were being raised by seventy hands when l shouted, knowing thatit was either my last chance or my final condemnation. 'i have beendown the cliff and worshiped at your altar! i follow the cross!'Alpha and the mob hesitated. I could see that they were wrestling withthis new thought. It was not easy for them.'! follow the cross and wish to be of the cruciform,' !said as calmly as I could. '! have been to your altar."'Those who do not follow the cross must die the true death,' calledGamma.'But he follows the cross,' said Alpha. 'He has prayed in the room."'This cannot be,' said Zed. 'The Three Score and Ten pray there and heis not of the Three Score and Ten."'We knew before this that he is not of the Three Score and Ten,' saidAlpha, frowning slightly as he dealt with the concept of past tense.'He is not of the cruciform,' said Delta-two.'Those who are not of the cruciform must die the true death,' said Beta.'He follows the cross,' said Alpha. 'Can he not then become of thecruciform?"An outcry arose. In the general babble and shuffle of forms I pulledagainst restraining hands but their grips remained firm.'He is not of the Three Score and Ten and is not of the cruciform,' saidBeta, sounding more puttied than hostile now. 'How is it that he shouldnot die the true death?We must take the stones and open his throat so that the blood flowsuntil his heart stops. He is not of the cruciform."'He follows the cross,' said Alpha. 'Can he not become of thecruciform?"This time silence followed the question.'He follows the cross and has prayed at the room of the cruciform,' saidAlpha, 'He must not die the true death."'All die the true death,' said a Bikura whom I did not recognize. Myarms were aching from the strain of holding the crucifix above my head.'Except the Three Score and Ten,' finished the anonymous Bikura.'Because they followed the cross, prayed at the room, and became of thecruciform,' said Alpha. 'Must he not then become of the cruciform?"I stood there gripping the cold metal of the small cross and awaitedtheir verdict. I was afraid to die - l felt afraid - but the largerpart of my mind seemed almost detached. My greatest regret was that Iwould not be able to send out the news of the basilica to an unbelievinguniverse.'Come, we will talk of this,' Beta said to the group and they pulled mewith them as they trod silently back to the village.They have imprisoned me here in my hut. There was no chance to try forthe hunting maser; several of them held me down while they emptied thehut of most of my possessions. They took my clothing, leaving me onlyone of their rough-woven robes to cover myself with.The longer I sit here the more angry and anxious 1 become. They havetaken my comlog, imager, disks, chips... everything. I have a single,unopened crate of medical diagnostic equipment left up at the old site,but that cannot help me document the miracle in the Cleft. If theydestroy the things they have taken- and thendestroy me - there will be no record of the basilica.If I had a weapon I could kill the guards andOh dear God what am I thinking? Edouard, what am I to do?And even if I survive this- make my way back to Keats- arrange travelback to the Web- who would believe me?-'after nine years' absence fromPacem because of the quantum-leap time-debt- just an old man returningwith the same lies he was exiled for- Oh, dear God, if they destroy thedata let them destroy me as well.Day 110:' After three days they have decided my fate.Zed and the one I think of as Theta-Prime came to get me shortly aftermidday. I blinked as they led me out into the light. The Three Scoreand Ten stood in a wide.semicircle near the cliff edge. I fully expected to be thrown over thatedge. Then I noticed the bonfire.I had assumed that the Bikura were so primitive that they had lost theart of making and using fire. They did not warm themselves with fireand their huts were always dark. I had never seen them cook a meal, noteven the rare corpse of an arboreal they devoured. But now the fire wasburning strongly and they were the only ones who could have started it.I looked to see what fueled the flames.They were burning my clothes, my comiog, my fieldnotes, the tape cassettes,- video chips, data disks, the imager ...everything that had held information. 1 screamed at them, tried tothrow myself at the fire, and called them names I had not used since thestreet days of my childhood. They ignored me.Finally Alpha came close. 'Yu will become of the cruciform,' he saidsoftly.I did not care. They led me back to my hut where l wept for an hour.There is no guard at the door. A minute ago I stood at the doorway andconsidered running for the flame forests. Then I thought of a muchshorter but no less fatal run to the Cleft.I did nothing.The sun will be setting in a short time. Already the winds are rising.Soon. Soon.Day 112:Has it been only two days? It has been forever.It did not come off this morning. It did not come off.The medscanner's image wafer is right here in front of me but I Stillcannot believe it. And yet I do. I am of the cruciform now.They came for me just before sunset. All of them. I did not struggleas they led me to the edge of the Cleft.They were more agile on the vines than I could have imagined. I slowedthem down but they were patient, showing me the easiest footholds, thefastest route.Hyperion's sun had dropped below low clouds and was visible above therim wall to the west as we walked the final few meters to the basilica.The evening windsong was louder than I had anticipated; it was as if wewere caught amid the pipes of a gigantic church organ. The notes rosefrom bass growls so deep that my bones and teeth resonated in sympathyto high, piercing screams that slid easily into the ultrasonic.Alpha opened the outer doors and we passed through the antechamber intothe central basilica. The Three Score and Ten made a wide circle aroundthe altar and its tall cross. There was no litany. There was nosinging.There was no ceremony. We simply stood there in silence as the windroared through the fluted columns outside and echoed in the great emptyroom carved into the stone - echoed and resonated and grew in volumeuntil I clapped my hands over my ears. And all the while the streaming,horizontal rays of sunlight f'dled the hall with deepening hues ofamber, gold, lapis, and then amber again- colors so deep that they madethe air thick with light and lay like paint against the skin. l watchedas the cross caught this light and held it in each of its thousandprecious stones, held it- it seemed - even after the sun had set and thewindows had faded to a twilight gray. It was as if the great crucifixhad absorbed the light and was radiating it toward us, into us. Theneven the cross was dark and the winds died and in the sudden dimnessAlpha said softly, 'Bring him along."We emerged onto the wide ledge of stone and Beta was there with torches.As Beta passed them out to a selected few, I wondered if the Bikurareserved fire for ritual purposes only. Then Beta was leading the wayand we descended the narrow staircase carved into the stone.At first I crept along, terrified, clutching at the smooth rock andsearching for any reassuring projection of root or stone. The drop toour right was so sheer and endless that it bordered on being absurd.Descending the ancient staircase was far worse than clutching at vineson the cliff face above. Here I had to look down each time I placed afoot on the narrow, age-slickened slabs. A slip and fall at firstseemed probable, then inevitable.I had the urge to stop then, to return at least to the safety of thebasilica, but most of the Three Score and Ten were behind me on thenarrow staircase and there seemed little chance that they would standaside to let me pass. Besides this, and even greater than my fear, wasthe nagging curiosity about what was at the bottom of the staircase. Idid pause long enough to glance up at the .lip of the Cleft three hundred meters above and to seethat the clouds were gone, the stars were out, and the nightly ballet ofmeteor trails was bright against a sable sky. Then I lowered my head,began a whispered recitationof the rosary, and followed the torchlight and the Bikura into thetreacherous depths.I could not believe that the staircase would take us all the way to thebottom of the Cleft, but it did. When, sometime after midnight, Irealized that we would be descending all the way down to the level ofthe river, 1 estimated that it would take us until noon of the next day,but it did not.We reached the base of the Cleft shortly before sunrise. The starsstill shone in the aperture of sky between cliff walls that rose animpossible distance on either side. Exhausted, staggering downward stepby step, recognizing slowly that there were no more steps, I staredupward and wondered stupidly if the stars remained visible there in thedaylight as they did in a well I had lowered myself into once as a childin Villefranche-sur-SaSne.'Here,' said Beta. It was the first word uttered in many hours and wasbarely audible over the roar of the river. The Three Score and Tenstopped where they were and stood motionless. I collapsed to my kneesand fell on my side. There was no possibility that I could climb thatstairway we had just descended. Not in a day. Not in a week. Perhapsnever. l closed my eyes to sleep but the dull fuel of nervous tensioncontinued to burn inside me. I looked out across the floor of theravine. The river here was wider than I had anticipated, at leastseventy meters across, and the noise of it was beyond mere noise; I feltthat I was being consumed by a great beast's roar.I sat up and stared at a patch of darkness in the opposing cliff wall.It was a shadow darker than the shadows, more regular than the serratedpatchwork of buttresses and crevices and columns that mottled the faceof the cliff. it was a perfect square of darkness, at least thirtymeters to a side. A door or hole in the cliff wall. I struggled to myfeet and looked downriver along the wall we had just descended; yes, itwas there. The other entrance, the one toward which Beta and the otherseven now were walking, was faintly visible in the starlight.l had found an entrance to Hyperion's labyrinth.'Did you know that Hyperion was one of the nine labyrinthine worlds?"someone had asked me on the dropship. Yes, it was the young priestnamed Hoyt. l had said yes and dismissed the fact. I was interested inthe Bikura - actually more in the self-inflicted pain of my own exile -not the labyrinths or their builders.Nine worlds have labyrinths. Nine out of a hundred seventy-sixWebworlds and another two hundred-some colonial and protectorateplanets. Nine worlds out of eight thousand or more worlds explored -however cursorily - since the Hegira.There are planetary archaeohistorians who devote their lives to thestudy of the labyrinths. Not I. I had always found them a steriletopic, vaguely unreal. Now I walked toward one with the Three Score andTen as the Kans River roared and vibrated and threatened to douse ourtorches with its spray.The labyrinths were dug ... tunneled ... created more than threequarters of a million standard years ago. The details were inevitablythe same, their origins inevitably unsoived.Labyrinthine worlds are always Earthlike, at least to 7.9 on the SolmevScale, always circling a G-type star, and yet always restricted toworlds that are tectonically dead, more like Mars than Old Earth. Thetunnels themselves are set deep- usually a minimum of ten kilometers butoften as deep as thirty - and they catacomb the crust of the planet. OnSvoboda, not far from Pacem's system, over eight hundred thousandkilometers of labyrinth have been explored by remotes.The tunnels on each world are thirty meters square and carved by sometechnology still not available to the Hegemony. I read once in anarchaeological journal that Kemp-HS!tzer and Weinstein had postulated a'fusion tunneler' that would explain the perfectly smooth walls and lackof tailings, but their theory did not explain where the Builders ortheir machines had come from or why they had devoted centuries to suchan apparently aimless engineering task. Each of the labyrinthineworlds- including Hyperion- has been probed and researched. Nothing hasever been found. No signs ofexcavation machinery, no rusting miners' helmets, not a single piece ofshattered plastic or decomposing stimstick wrapper. Researchers havenot even identified entrance and exit shafts. No suggestion of heavymetals or precious ores has been sufficient to explain such a monumentaleffort. No legend or artifact of the Labyrinth Builders has survived.The mystery had mildly intrigued me over the years but never concernedme.Until now.We entered the tunnel mouth. It was not a perfect square. Erosion andgravity had turned the perfect tunnel into a rough cave for a hundredmeters into the cliff wall. Beta stopped just where the tunnel floorgrew smooth and extinguished his torch. The other Bikura did likewise.It was very dark. The tunnel had turned enough to block out anystarlight that might have entered. I had been in caves before. Withthe torches extinguished, I did not expect my eyes to adapt to thenear-total darkness.But they did.Within thirty seconds I began to sense a roseate glow, dim at first,then ever richer until the cave was brighter than the canyon had been,brighter than Pacem under the glow of its triune moons. The light camefrom a hundred sources- a thousand sources. I was able to make out thenature of these sources just as the Bikura dropped reverently to theirknees.The cave walls and ceiling were encrusted with crosses ranging in sizefrom a few millimeters to almost a meter long. Each glowed with a deep,pink light of its own.Invisible in the torchlight, these glowing crosses now suffused thetunnel with light. I approached one embedded in the wall nearest me.Thirty or so centimeters across, it pulsed with a soft, organic flow.This was not something that had been carved out of stone or attached tothe wall; it was definitely organic, definitely alive, resembling softcoral. It was slightly warm to the touch.There came the slightest whisper of sound - no, not sound, a disturbancein the cool air, perhaps - and 1 turned in time to see something enterthe chamber.The Bikura were still kneeling, their heads down, eyes lowered. Iremained standing. My gaze never left the thing which moved among thekneeling Bikura.It was vaguely man-shaped but in no way human. It stood at least threemeters tall. Even when it was at rest, the silvered surface of thething seemed to shift and flow like mercury suspended in midair. Thereddish glow from the crosses set into the tunnel walls reflected fromsharp surfaces and glinted on the curved metal blades protruding fromthe thing's forehead, four wrists, oddly jointed elbows, knees, armoredback, and thorax. It flowed between the kneeling Bikura, and when itextended four long arms, hands extended but fingers clicking into placelike chrome scalpels, I was absurdly reminded of His Holiness on Pacemoffering a benediction to the faithful.I had no doubt that I was looking at the legendary Shrike.At that moment I must have moved or made a sound, for large red eyesturned my way and I found myself hypnotized by the dance of light withinthe multifaceted prisms there: not merely reflected light but a fierce,blood-bright glow which seemed to burn within the creature's barbedskull and pulse in the terrible gems set where God meant eyes to be.Then it moved ... or, rather, it did not move but ceased being thereand was here, leaning less than a meter from me, its oddly jointed armsencircling me in a fence of body-blades and liquid silver steel. Pantinghard but unable to take a breath, I saw my own reflection, face whiteand distorted, dancing across the surface of the thing's metallic shelland burning eyes.I confess that I felt something closer to exaltation than fear.Something inexplicable was happening. Forged in Jesuit logic andtempered in the cold bath of science, !nevertheless understood at that second the ancient obsession of theGod-fearing for another kind of fear: the thrill of exorcism, themindless whirl of Dervish possession, the puppet-dance ritual of Tarot,and the almost erotic surrender of sance, speaking in tongues, and ZenGnostic trance. I realized at that instant justhow surely the affirmation of demons or the summoning of Satan somehowcan affirm the reality of their mystic antithesis - the God of Abraham.Thinking none of this but feeling all of it, I awaited the embrace ofthe Shrike with the imperceptible tremble of a virgin bride.It disappeared.There was no thunderclap, no sudden smell of brimstone, not even ascientifically sound inrush of air. One second the thing was there,surrounding me with its beautiful certainty of sharp-edged death, andthe next instant it was gone.Numbed, I stood there and blinked as Alpha rose and approached me in theBosch-tinted gloom. He stood where the Shrike had stood, his own armsextended in a pathetic imitation of the deadly perfection I had justwitnessed, but there was no sign on Alpha's bland, Bikura face that hehad seen the creature. He made an awkward, open-handed gesture whichseemed to include the labyrinth, cave wall, and scores of glowingcrosses embedded there.'Cruciform,' said Alpha. The Three Score and Ten rose, came closer, andknelt again. I looked at their placid faces in the soft light and Ialso knelt.'You will follow the cross all of your days,' said Alpha, and his voicecarried the cadence of litany. The rest of the Bikura repeated thestatement in a tone just short of a chant.'You wR! be of the cruciform all of your days,' said Alpha, and as theothers repeated this he reached out and pulled a small cruciform awayfrom the cave wall. It was not more than a dozen centimeters long andit came away from the wall with the faintest of snaps. Its glow fadedeven as I watched. Alpha removed a small thong from his robe, tied itaround small knobs at the top of the cruciform, and held the cross abovemy head. 'Youwill be of the cruciform now and forever,' he said.'Now and forever,' echoed the Bikura.'Amen,' I whispered.Beta signaled that I should open the front of my robe.Alpha lowered the-small cross until it hung around myneck. It eit cool against my chest; the back of it was perfectly flat,perfectly smooth.The Bikura stood and wandered toward the cave entrance, apparentlyapathetic and indifferent once again. I watched them leave and then Igingerly touched the cross, lifted and inspected it. The cruciform wascool, inert. If it had truly been living a few seconds earlier, itshowed no sign of it now. It continued to feel more like coral thancrystal or rock; there was no sign of any adhesive material on thesmooth back of it. I speculated on photochemical effects that wouldhave created the luminescent quality. I speculated on natural phos-phors, bioluminescence, and on the chances that evolution would shapesuch things. I speculated on what, if anything, their presence here hadto do with the labyrinth and on the aeons necessary to raise thisplateau so the river and canyon could slice through one of the tunnels.I speculated on the basilica and its makers, on the Bikura, on theShrike, and on myself. Eventually I ceased speculating and closed myeyes to pray.When I emerged from the cave, the cruciform cool against my chest underthe robe, the Three Score and Ten were .obviously ready to begin thethree-kilometer climb up the staircase. I looked up to'see a pale slashof morning sky between the walls of the Cleft.'No!" I shouted, my voice almost lost against the roar of the river. 'Ineed rest. Rest!" I sank to my knees on the sand but half a dozen ofthe Bikura approached, pulled me gently to my feet, and moved me towardthe staircase.I tried, the Lord knows that I tried, but two or three hours into theclimb I felt my legs give way and I collapsed, sliding across the rock,unable to stop my six-hundred-meter fall to the rocks and river. 1remember grasping at the cruciform under the thick robe and then half adozen hands stopped my slide, lifted me, carried me. Then I remember nomore.Until this morning. 1 woke to a sunrise pouring light through theopening of my hut. I wore only the robe and a touch assured me that thecruciform was still hanging from its fibrous thong. As I watched thesun lift over theforest, I realized that I had lost a day, that somehow 1 had sleptthrough not only my ascent up that endless staircase (how could theselittle people carry me two and a half vertical kilometers?) but throughthe next day and night as wellI looked around my hut. My comlog and other recording devices weregone. Only my medscanner and a few packets of anthropological softwaremade useless by the destruction of my other equipment remained. I shookmy head and went up to the stream to wash.The Bikura appeared to be sleeping. Now that I had participated intheir ritual and 'become of the cruciform,' they seemed to have lostinterest in me. As 1 stripped to bathe, I decided to take no interestin them. I decided that I would leave as soon as I was strong enough. Iwould find a way around the flame forests if necessary. I could descendthe staircase and follow the Kans if I had to. I knew more than everthat word of these miraculous artifacts had to be brought to the outsideworld.I pulled off the heavy robe, stood pale and shivering in the morninglight, and went to lift the small cruciform from my chest.It did not come off.It lay there as if it were part of my flesh. I pulled, scraped, andtore at the thong until it snapped and fell away. I clawed at thecross-shaped lump on my chest. It did not come off. It was as if myflesh had sealed itself around the edges of the cruciform. Except forthe scratches from my fingernails, there was no pain or physicalsensation in the cruciform or surrounding flesh, only sheer terror in mysoul at the thought of this thing attached to me. After the first rushof panic subsided, 1 sat a minute and then hastily pulled on my robe andran back to the village.My knife was gone, my maser, scissors, razor - everything that mighthave helped me peel back the growth on my chest. My nails left bloodytracks across the red welt and my chest. Then I remembered themedscanner. 1 passed the transceiver over my chest, read the diskeydisplay, shook my head in disbelief, and then ran an entire body scan.After a while I keyed in a request for hard copies of the scan resultsand sat motionless for a very long time..I sit here now holding the image wafers. The cruciform is quite visibleon both the sonic and k-cross images .. as are the internal fibersthat spread like thin tentacles, like roots, throughout my body.Excess ganglia radiate from a thick nucleus above my sternum tofilaments everywhere- a nightmare of nematodes. As well as I can tellwith my simple field scanner, the nematodes terminate in the amygdalaand other basal ganglia in each cerebral hemisphere. My temperature,metabolism, and !ymphocyte level are normal.There has been no invasion of foreign tissue.According to the scanner, the nematodic filaments are the result ofextensive but simple metastasis. According to the scanner, thecruciform itself is composed of familiar tissue... the DNA is mine.I am of the cruciform.Day 116:Each day I pace the confines of my cage - the flame  forests to thesouth and east, the forested ravines to the northeast, and the Cleft tothe north and west. The Three Score and Ten will not let me descendinto the Cleft beyond the basilica. The cruciform will not let me getmore than ten kilometers from the Cleft.At first I could not believe this. I had resolved to enter the flameforests, trusting to luck and to God's help to see me through. But Ihad gone no more than two kilometers into the fringes of the forest whenpain struck me in the chest and arms and head. I was sure that !-washaving a massive heart attack. But as soon as i turned back toward theCleft the symptoms ceased. I experimented for some time and the resultswere invariably the same. Whenever I ventured deeper into the flameforest, away from the Cleft, the pain would return and increase inseverity until I turned back.I begin to understand other things. 'Yesterday Ihappened across the wreckage of the original seedship shuttle as Iexplored to the north. Only a rusted, vine-enmeshed wreck of' metalremains among the rocks at the edge of the flame forest near the ravine.But crouching among the exposed alloy ribs of the ancient craft, I couldimagine the rejoicing of the seventy survivors, their short voyage tothe Cleft, their eventual discovery of the basilica, and ... and what?Conjectures beyond that point are useless, but suspicions remain.Tomorrow I will attempt another physical exam of one of the Bikura.Perhaps now that I am 'of the cruciform' they will allow it.Each day I do a reedscan of myself. The nematodes remain - perhapsthicker, perhaps not. l am convinced that they are purely parasiticalthough my body has shown no signs of this. I peer at my face in thepool near the waterfall and see only the same long, aging countenancethat I have learned to dislike in recent years: This niorning, whilegazing at my image in the water, l opened my mouth wide, half thinkingthat I would see gray filaments and nematode clusters growing from theroof of my mouth and the back of my throat. There was nothing.Day liT:The Bikura are sexless. Not celibate or herma-phroditic or undeveloped- sexless. They are as devoid of external or internal genitalia as achild's flowfoam doll. There is no evidence that the penis or testes orcomparable female organs have atrophied or been surgically altered.There is no sign that they ever existed.Urine is conducted through a primitive urethra terminating in a smallchamber contiguous with the anus - a sort of crude cloaca.Beta allowed the examination. The reedscanner confirmed what my eyeswould not believe. Del and Theta also agreed to be scanned. I haveabsolutely no doubt that the rest of the Three Score and Ten are equallysexless. There is no sign that they have been... altered.i would suggest that they had all been born that way but from what kindof parents?. And how do these sexless lumps of human clay plan toreproduce? It must be tied in with the cruciform in some way.When I was finished with their medscans I stripped and studied myself.The cruciform rises from my chest like pink scar tissue, but I am stilla man.For how long?Day 133:Alpha is dead.I was with him three mornings ago when he fell. We were about threekilometers east, hunting for chalma tubers in the large boulders nearthe edge of the Cleft. It had been raining most of the past two daysand the rocks were quite slippery. I looked up from my own scramblingjust in time to see Alpha lose his footing and go sliding down a broadslab of stone, over the edge. He did not shout. The only sound was therasp of his robe against the rock, followed several seconds later by thesickening dropped-melon sound of his body striking a ledge eighty metersbelow.It took me an hour to find a route down to him. Even before I began thetreacherous descent I knew it was too late to help. But it was my duty.Alpha's body was half wedged between two large rocks. He must have diedinstantly; his arms and legs were splintered and the right side of hisskull had been crushed. Blood and brain tissue clung to the wet rocklike the refuse of a sad picnic. I wept as I stood over the littlebody. I do not know why I wept, but I did. And as l wept Iadministered Extreme Unction and prayed that God would accept the soulof this poor, sexless little person. Later I wrapped the body in vines,laboriously climbed the eighty meters of cliff, and - pausing frequentlyto pant with exhaustion- pulled the broken corpse up to me.There was little interest as I carried the body of Alpha into the Bikuravillage. Eventually Beta and half a dozenothers wandered over to stare down indifferently at the corpse. No oneasked me how he had died. After a few minutes the small crowddispersed.Later l'carried Alpha's body to the promontory where I had buried Tuk somany weeks earlier. I was digging the shallow grave with a flat stonewhen Gamma appeared. The Bikura's eyes widened and for a brief second Ithought I saw emotion cross those bland features.'What are you doing?" asked Gamma.'Burying him." I was too tired to say more. I leaned against a thickchalma root and rested.'No." It was a command. 'He is of the cruciform."I stared as Gamma turned and walked quickly back to the village. Whenthe Bikura was gone, I pulled off the crude fiber tarp I had draped overthe corpse.Alpha was, without any doubt, truly dead. It no longer mattered to himor the universe whether he was of the cruciform or not. The fall hadstripped him of most of his clothes and all of his dignity. The rightside of his skull had been cracked and emptied like a breakfast egg.One eye stared sightlessly toward Hyperion's sky through a thickeningfilm while the other looked out lazily from under a drooping lid. Hisrib cage had been splintered so thoroughly that shards of bone protrudedfrom his flesh. Both arms were broken and his left leg had been twistedalmost off. I had used the medscanner to perform a perfunctory autopsyand it had revealed massive internal injuries; even the poor devil'sheart had been pulped by the force of the fall.I reached out and touched the cold flesh. Rigor mortis was setting in.My fingers brushed across the cross-shaped welt on his chest and Iquickly pulled. my handaway. The cruciform was warm.'Stand away."I looked up to see Beta and the rest of the Bikura standing there. Ihad no doubt that they would murder me in a second if I did not moveaway from the corpse.As I did so, an idiotically frightened part of my mind noted that theThree Score and Ten were now the Three Score and Nine. It seemed funnyat the time.The Bikura lifted the body and moved back toward the village. Betalooked at the sky, looked at me, and said:'It is almost time. You will come."We went down into the Cleft. The body was carefully tied into a basketof vines and lowered with us.The sun was not yet illuminating the interior of the basilica when theyset Alpha's corpse on the broad altar and removed his remaining rags.I do not know what I expected next - some ritual act of cannibalismperhaps. Nothing would have surprised me. Instead, one of the Bikuraraised his arms, just as the first shafts of colored light entered thebasilica, and intoned, 'You will follow the cross all of your days."The Three Score and Nine knelt and repeated the sentence. I remainedstanding. I did not speak.'You will be of the cruciform all of your days,' said the little Bikuraand the basilica echoed to the chorus of voices repeating the phrase.Light the color and texture of clotting blood threw a huge shadow of thecross on the far wall.'You will be of the cruciform now and forever and ever,' came the chantas the winds rose outside and the organ pipes of the canyon wailed withthe voice of a tortured child.When the Bikura stopped chanting I did not whisper 'Amen." I stood therewhile the others turned and left with the sudden, total indifference ofspoiled children who have lost interest in their game.'There is no reason to stay,' said Beta when the others had gone.'l want to,' I said, expecting a command to leave. Beta turned withoutso much as a shrug and left me there. The light dimmed. I went outsideto watch the sun set and when I returned it had begun.Once, years ago in school, I saw a time-lapse holo showing thedecomposition of a kangaroo mouse. A week's slow work of nature'srecycling had been accelerated to thirty seconds of horror. There wasthe sudden, almost comic bloating of the little corpse, then thestretching of flesh into lesions, followed by the suddenappearance of maggots in the mouth, eyes, and open sores, and finallythe sudden and incredible corkscrew cleaning of meat from the bones-there is no other phrase that fits the image- as the pack of maggotsspiraled right to left, head to tail, in a time-lapsed helix of carrionconsumption that left behind nothing but bones and gristle and hide.Now it was a man's body I watched.I stopped and stared, the last of the light fading quickly. There wasno sound in the echoing silence of the basilica except for the poundingof my pulse in my own ears. I stared as Alpha's corpse 'first twitchedand then visibly vibrated, almost !evitating off the altar in thespastic violence of sudden decomposition. For a few seconds thecruciform seemed to increase in size and deepen in color, glowing as redas raw meat, and I imagined then that I caught a glimpse of the networkof filaments and nematodes holding the disintegrating body together likemetal fibers in a sculptor's melting model. Theflesh flowed.I stayed in the basilica that night. The area around the altar remained!it by the glow of the cruciform on Alpha's chest. When the corpsemoved the light would cast strange shadows on the walls.I did not leave the basilica until Alpha left on the third day, but mostof the visible changes had taken place by the end of that first night.The body of the Bikura I had named .Alpha was broken down and rebuilt as1 watched. The corpse t.hat was left was not quite Alpha and not quitenot Alpha, but it was intact. The face was a flowfoam do!l's face,smooth and unlined, features stamped in a slight smile. At sunrise ofthe third day, i saw the corpse's chest begin to rise and fall and Iheard the first intake of breath- a rasp like water being poured into aleather pouch. Shortly before noon I leftthe basilica to climb the vines.I followed Alpha.He has not spoken, will not reply. His eyes have a fixed, unfocusedlook and occasionally he pauses as if he hears distant voices calling.No one paid attention to us when we returned to thevillage. Alpha went to a hut and sits there now. 1 sit in mine. Aminute ago I opened my robe and ran my fingers across the welt of thecruciform. It lies benignly under the flesh of my chest. Waiting.Day 140:I am recovering from my wounds and the loss of blood. It cannot be cutout with a sharpened stone.It does not like pain. I lost consciousness long before the pain orloss of blood demanded it. Each time I awoke and resumed cutting, Iwould be made to pass out. It does not like pain.Day 158:Alpha speaks some now. He seems duller, slower, and only vaguely awareof me (or anyone else) but he eats and moves. He appears to recognizeme to some extent.The reedscanner shows the heart and internal organs of a young man -perhaps of a boy of sixteen.I must walt about another Hyperion month and ten days-about fifty daysin all- until the flame fores become quiet enough for me to try to walkout, pain or no pain. We will see who can stand the mostpain.Day 173:Another death.The one called Will - the one with the broken finger - had been missingfor a week. Yesterday the Bikura went several kilometers northeast asif following a beacon, and found the remains near the great ravine.Evidently a branch had snapped while he was climbing to grasp somehalma fronds. Death must have been instantaneous when he broke hisneck, but it is where he fell that is important. The body - if onecould call itthat - was lying between two great mud cones marking the burrows of thelarge red insects that Tuk called fire mnntises. Carpet beetles mighthave been a more apt phrase. In the past few days the insects hadstripped the c6rpse clean to the bone. Little was left to be foundexcept the skeleton, some random shreds of tissue and tendon, and thecruciform - still attached to the rib cage like some splendid crosspacked in the sarcophagus of a long-dead pope.It is terrible, but I cannot help but feel some small sense of triumphbeneath the sadness. There is no way thai the cruciform can regeneratesomething out of these bare bones; even the terrible illogic of thisaccursed parasite must respect the imperative of the law of conservationof mass. The Bikura I called Will has died the true death. The ThreeScore and Ten truly are the Three Score and Nine from this time on.Day 174:I am a fool.Today I inquired about Will, about his dying the true death. I wascurious at the lack of reaction from the Bikura. They had retrieved thecruciform but left the skeleton lying where they had found it; there wasno attempt to carry the remains to the basilica. During the night I hadbecome concerned that I would be made to fill the roll of the missingmember of the Three Score and Ten. 'It is very sad,' I said, 'that oneof you has died the true death. What is to become to the Three Scoreand Ten?"Beta stared'at me. 'He cannot die the true death,' said the bald littleandrogyny. 'He is of the cruciform."Somewhat later, while continuing my medscans of the tribe, I discoveredthe truth. The one 1 have tagged as Theta looks the same and acts thesame, but now carries two cruciforms embedded in his flesh. I have nodoubt that this is one Bikura who will tend toward corpulence in comingyears, swelling and ripening like some obscene E coli cell in a petridish. When he/she/it dies, two will leave the tomb and the Three Scoreand Ten will be complete once more.I believe I am going mad.Day 195:Weeks of studying the damn parasite and still no clue as to how itfunctions. Worse, I no longer care. What I care about now is moreimportant.Why has GOd allowed this obscenity?Why have the Bikura been punished this way?Why was I chosen to suffer their fate?I ask these questions in nightly prayers but I hear no answers, only theblood song of the wind from the Cleft.Day 214:The last ten pages should have covered all of my field notes andtechnical conjectures. This will be my last entry before attempting thequiescent flame forest in the morning.There is no doubt that I have discovered the ultimate in stagnant humansocieties. The Bikura have realized the human dream of immortality andhave paid for it with their humanity and their immortal souls.Edouard, I have spent-so many hours wrestling with my faith - my lack offaith - but now, in this fearful corner of an all but forgotten world,riddied as I am with this loathsome parasite, I have somehowrediscovered a strength of belief the likes of which I have not knownsince you and I were boys. I now understand the need for faith- pure,blind, fly-in-the-face-of-reason faith- as a small life preserver in thewild and endless sea of a universe ruled by unfeeling laws and totallyindifferent to the small, reasoning beings that inhabit it.Day after day I have tried to leave the Cleft area and day after day Ihave suffered pain so terrible that it has become a tangible part of myworld, like the too smallsun or the green and lapis sky. Pain has become my ally, my guardianangel, my remaining link with humanity.The cruciform does not like pain. Nor do I but, like the cruciform, Iam willing to use it to serve my purposes.And I will do so consciously, not instinctively like the mindless massof alien tissue embedded in me. This thing only seeks a mindlessavoidance of death by any means.I do not wish to die, but I welcome pain and death rather than aneternity of mindless life. Life is sacred - I still 'hold to that as acore element of the Church's thought and teachings these pasttwenty-eight hundred years when life has been so cheap - but even moresacred is the soul.I realize now that what I was trying to do with the Armaghast data wasoffer the Church not a rebirth but only a transition to a false lifesuch as these poor walking corpses inhabit. If the Church is meant todie, it must do so - but do so gloriously, in the full knowledge of itsrebirth in Christ. It must go into the darkness not willingly but well- bravely and firm of faith - like the millions who have gone before us,keeping faith with all those generations facing death in the isolatedsilence of death camps and nuclear fireballs and cancer wards andpogroms, going into the darkness, if not hopefully, then prayerfullythat there is some reason for it all, something worth the price of allthat pain, all those sacrifices.All those before us have gone into the darkness without assurance oflogic or fact or persuasive theory, with only a slender thread of hopeor the all too shakable conviction of faith. And if they have been ableto sustain that slim hope in the face of darkness, then so must I... andso must the Church.! no longer believe that any surgery or treatment can cure me of thisthing that infests me, but if someone can separate it and study it anddestroy it, even at the cost of my death, l will be well satisfied.The flame forests are as quiet as they will ever be. To bed now. Ileave before dawn.Day. 215:There is no way out.Fourteen kilometers into the forest. Stray fires and bursts of current,but penetrable. Three weeks of walking would have got me through.The cruciform will not let me go.The pain was like a heart attack that would not stop.Still I staggered forward, stumbling and crawling through the ash.Eventually I lost consciousness. When I came to I was crawling towardthe Cleft. I would turn away, walk a kilometer, crawl fifty meters,then lose consciousness again and awakeback where I had started.All day this insane battle for my body went on.Before sunset the Bikura entered the forest, found mefive kilometers from the Cleft, and carried me back.Dear Jesus, why have you let this be?There is no hope now unless someone comes looking for me.Day 223:Again the attempt. Again the pain. Again the failure.Day257:I am sixty-eight standard years old today. Work goes on with the chapelI am building near the Cleft.Attempted to descend to the river yesterday but was turned back by Betaand four others.Day 280:One local year on Hyperion. One year in purgatory.Or is it hell?Day311:Working on quarrying stones on the ledges below the shelf where thechapel is going up and I made the discovery today: the arrestor rods.The Bikura must have thrown them over the edge when they murdered Tukthat night two hundred and twenty-three days ago.These rods would allow me to penetrate the flame forest at any time ifthe cruciform would allow it. But it will not. If only they had notdestroyed my medkits with the painkillers! But still, sitting hereholding the rods today, I have an idea.My crude experiments with the medscanner have continued.Two weeks ago when Theta broke his leg in three places, I observed thereaction of the cruciform. The parasite did its best to block the pain;Theta was unconscious much of the time and his body was producingincredible quantities of endorphins. But the break was a very painfulone and after four days the Bikura slashed Theta's throat and took hisbody to the basilica. It was easier for the cruciform to resurrect hiscorpse than to tolerate such pain over a long period. But before hismurder my scanner showed an appreciable retreat of the cruciformnematodes from some parts of the central nervous system.I do not know if it would be possible to inflict on oneself - or totolerate - levels of nonlethal pain sufficient to drive the cruciformout completely, but I am sure of one thing: the Bikura would not allowit.Today I sit on the ledge below the half-finished chapel and I considerpossibilities.Day 438:The chapel is finished. It is my !ife's work.Tonight, when the Bikura went down into the Cleft for their daily parodyof worship, I said Mass at the altar of the newly erected chapel. I hadbaked the bread from chalma flour and I am sure that it must have tastedof that bland, yellow leaf, but to me the taste was exactly like that ofthe first Host I had partaken of during my first Holy Communion inVillefranche-sur-Sa/}ne some sixty standard years earlier.!n the morning 1 will do what I have planned. Everything is inreadiness: my journals and the medscan wafers will be in the pouch ofwoven bestos fibers. That is the best I can do.The consecrated wine was only water, but in the dim light of sunset itlooked blood red and tasted of communion wine.The trick will be to penetrate deep enough into the flame forest. Iwill have to trust that there is enough incipient activity in and fromthe tesla trees even during the quiet periods.Goodbye, Edouard. I doubt if you are still alive, and should you be, 1see no way that we could be reunited, separated aswe are not only byyears of distance but by a much wider gulf in the form of a cross. Myhope of seeing you again shall not be placed on this life but on the oneto come. Strange to hear me speak like this again, is it not? I musttell you, Edouard, that after all these decades of uncertainty, and withgreat fear of what lies ahead, my heart and soul are nonetheless atpeace.Oh, my God,I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee, And I detest all my sins,Because of the loss of heaven And the pains of hell,But most of all because I have offended Thee, My God,Who art all goodAnd deserving of all my love."I firmly resolve with the help of Thy grace toconfess my sins, to do penance,And to amend my life,Amen.2400 hours:The sunset comes through the open chapel window and bathes the altar,the crudely carved chalice, and mein light. The wind from the Cleft rises in the last such chorus that -with luck and God's mercy - I will ever hear.'That is the final entry,' said Lenar Hoyt.When th priest quit reading, the six pilgrims at the table raised theirfaces toward him as if they were awakening from a common dream. TheConsul glanced upward and saw that Hyperion was much closer now, fillinga third of the sky, banishing the stars with its cold radiance.'I arrived some ten weeks after. 1 had last seen Father Dur6,'continued Father Hoyt. His voice was a hoarse rasp. 'More than eightyears had passed on Hyperion .. seven years since the last entry inFather Dul's journal." The priest was visibly in pain now, his facepaled to a sick !uminescence and filmed with perspiration.'Within a month I found my way to Perecebo Plantation upriver from PortRomance,' he continued, forcing some strength into his voice. 'Myassumption was that the fiberplastic growers might tell me the trutheven if they would have nothing to do with the consulate or Home RuleAuthorities. I was right. The administrator at Perecebo, a man namedOrlandi, remembered Father Dur, as did Orlandi's new wife, the womannamed Semfa whom Father Dur6 mentioned in his journals.The plantation manager had tried to mount several rescue operations ontothe Plateau, but an unprecedented series of active seasons in the flameforests had made them abandon their attempts. After several years theyhad given up hope that Dur or their man Tuk could still be alive.'Nonetheless, Orlandi recruited two expert bush pilots to fly a rescueexpedition up the Cleft in two plantation skimmers. We stayed in theCleft itself for as long as we could, trusting to terrain-avoidanceinstruments and luck to get us to Bikura country. Even with bypassingmost of the flame forest that way, we lost one of the skimmers and fourpeople to tesla activity."Father Hoyt paused and swayed slightly. Gripping theedge of the table to steady himself, he cleared his throat and said,'There's little else to tell. We located the Bikura village. Therewere seventy of them, each as stupid and uncommunicative as Dur's noteshad suggested.I managed to ascertain from them that Father Dur6 had died while tryingto penetrate the flame forest. The bestos pouch had survived and in itwe found his journals and medical data." Hoyt looked at the others asecond and then glanced down. 'We persuaded them to show us whereFather Dur6 had died,' he said. 'They...ah... they had not buried him. His remains were badly burned anddecomposed but complete enough to show us that the intensity of thetesla charges had destroyed the... the cruciform... as well as hisbody.'Father Dur6 had died the true death We returned the remains to thePerecebo Plantation where he was buried following a full funeral Mass."Hoyt took a deep breath. 'Over my strong objections, M. Orlandidestroyed the Bikura village and a section of the Cleft wall with shapednuclear charges he had brought from the plantation. I do not believethat any of the Bikura could have survived. As far as we could tell,the entrance to the labyrinth and the so-called basilica also must havebeen destroyed in the landslide.'1 had sustained se/eral injuries during the expedition and thus had toremain at the plantation for several months before returning to thenorthern continent and booking passage to Pacem. No one knows of thesejournals or their contents except M. Orlandi, Monsignor Edouard, andwhichever of his superiors Monsignor Edouard chose to tell. As far as Iknow, the Church has issued no declaration relating to the journals ofFather Paul Dur6."Father Hoyt had been standing and now he sat. Sweat dripped from hischin and his face was blue-white in the reflected light of Hyperion.'Is that... all?" asked Martin Silenus.'Yes,' managed Father Hoyt.'Gentlemen and lady,' said Het Masteen, 'it is late. 1 suggest that yougather your luggage and rendezvous at our friend the Consui's ship onsphere eleven in thirtyminutes or sooner. I will be using one of the tree's drop-ships to joinyou later."Most of the group was assembled in less than fifteen minutes. TheTemplars had rigged a gangway from a work pier on the interior of thesphere to the ship's top-tier balcony, and the Consul led the way intothe lounge as crew clones stowed luggage and departed.'A fascinating old instrument,' said Colonel Kassad as he ran one handacross the top of the Steinway.'Harpsichord?"'Piano,' said the Consul. 'Pre-Hegira. Are we all here?"'Everyone except Hoyt,' said Brawne Lamia as she.took a seat in the projection pit.Het Masteen entered. 'The Hegemony warship has granted permission foryou to descend to Keats's space-port,' said the Captain. He glancedaround. 'I will send a crew member to see if M. Hoyt needsassistance."'No,' said the Consul. He modulated his voice. 'I'd like to get him.Can you tell me the way to his quarters?"The treeship Captain looked at the Consul for a long second and thenreached into the folds of his robe. 'Bon voyage,' he said, handing overa wafer. 'I will see you on the planet, sometime before our midnightdeparture time from the Shrike's Temple in Keats."The Consul bowed. 'It was a pleasure traveling within the protectivebranches of the Tree, Het Masteen,' he said formally. Turning to theothers, he gestured.'Please make yourselves comfortable in the lounge or the library on thedesk below this. The ship will see to your needs and answer anyquestions you might have.We will depart as soon as Father Hoyt and I return."The priest's environment pod was halfway up the treeship, far out on asecondary branch. As the Consul expected, the comlog direction waferHet Masteen had given him also served as a palmlock override. Afteruseless minutes tapping the announcer chime and pounding on the accessportal, the Consul triggered the override and stepped into the pod.Father Hoyt was on his knees, writhing in the center of the grasscarpet. Bedclothes, gear, garments, and the contents of a standardmedkit were strewn on the floor around him. He had torn off his tunicand collar and sweated through his shirt so that it now hung in dampfolds, ripped and tattered where he had clawed through the fabric.Hyperion light seeped through the pod wall, making the bizarre tableauappear to be staged underwater - or, thought the Consul, in a cathedral.Lenar Hoyt's face contorted in agony as his hands raked at his chest.Muscles on his exposed forearms writhed like living creatures movingbeneath his pale tarp of a skin. 'The injector... malfunctioned,'gasped Hoyt. 'Please."The Consul nodded, commanded the door to close, and knelt next to thepriest. He removed the useless injector from Hoyt's clenched fist andejected the syrette ampule. Ultramorphine. The Consul nodded again andtook out an injector from the medkit he had brought from his ship. Ittook less than five seconds to load the ultramorph.'Please,' begged Hoyt. His whole body spasmed. The Consul could almostsee the waves of pain passing through the man.'Yes,' said the Consul. He took a ragged breath. 'But first the restof the story."Hoyt stared, reached weakly for the injector.Sweating himself now, the Consul held the instrument just out of reach.'Yes, in a second,' he said. 'After the rest of the story. It'simportant that I know."'Oh, God, sweet Christ,' sobbed Hoyt. 'Please!''Yes,' gasped the Consul. 'Yes. As soon as you tell me the truth."Father Hoyt collapsed onto his forearms, breathing in quick pants. 'Youfucking bastard,' he gasped. The priest took several deep breaths, heldone until his body quit shaking, and tried to sit up. When he looked atthe Consul, there was something like relief in the maddenedeyes. 'Then... you'll give me... the shot?"'Yes,' said the Consul.'All right,' Hoyt managed in a sour whisper. 'Thetruth. Perecebo Plantation... like I said. We flew in ... earlyOctober ... Lycius ... eight years after Dur6 ... disappeared. Oh,Christ, it hurts! Alcohol and endos don't work at all anymore. Only...pure ultramorph..."'Yes,' whispered the Consul. 'It's ready. As soon as the story isdone."The priest lowered his head. Sweat dripped from his cheeks and noseonto the short grass. The Consul saw the man's muscles tense as if hewere going to attack, then another spasm of pain wracked the thin bodyand Hoyt sagged forward. 'Skimmer wasn't destroyed...by tesla. Semfa, two men, and I... forced down near the Cleft while...while Orlandi searched upriver. His skimmer... had to wait while thelightning storm died down.'Bikura came in the night. Killed... killed Semfa, the pilot, theother man... forget his name. Left me .. alive." Hoyt reached forhis crucifix, realized that he had torn it off. He laughed briefly,stopping before the laughter turned to sobs. 'They... told me aboutthe way of the cross. About the cruciform. Told me about .. the Sonof the Flames.'Next morning, they took me to see the Son. Took me .. to see him."Hoyt struggled upright and clawed at his own cheeks. His eyes werewide, the ultramorph obviously forgotten despite the pain. 'About threekilometers into the flame forest... big tesla... eighty, a hundredmeters tall, at least. Quiet then, but still a lot ... a lot of chargein the air. Ash everywhere.'The Bikura wouldn't... wouldn't go too close. Just knelt there withtheir goddamned bald heads bowed. But I... went close... had to. DearGod... Oh, Christ, it was him. Dur6. What was left of him.'He'd used a ladder to get three ... maybe four meters... up on thebole of the tree.

'The painkillers worked all right at first. But everyyear... every day ... got worse. Even in fugue... the pain. I wouldhave had to come back anyway. How could he . . . seven years! Oh,Jesus,' said Father Hoyt and clawed at the carpet.The Consul moved quickly, injecting the full ampule of ultramorph justunder the armpit, catching the priest as he collapsed, and gentlylowering the unconscious form to the floor. His vision unclear, theConsul ripped open Hoyt's sweat-sodden shirt, casting the rags aside.It was there, of course, lying under the pale skin of Hoyt's chest likesome great, raw, cross-shaped worm.The Consul took a breath and gently turned the priest over. The secondcruciform was where he had expected to find it, a slightly smaller,cross-shaped welt between the thin man's shoulder blades. It stirredslightly as the Consu!'s fingers brushed the fevered flesh.The Consul moved slowly but efficiently- packing the priest'sbelongings, straightening the room, dressing the unconscious man withthe gentle care one would use in clothing the body of a dead familymember.The Consui's.comiog buzzed. 'We need to go,' came Colonel Kassad'svoice.'We're coming,' replied the Consul. He coded the comlog to summon crewclones to fetch the luggage, but lifted Father Hoyt himself. The bodyseemed to weigh nothing.The door dilated open and the Consul stepped out, moving from the deepshadow of the branch into the blue-green glow of the world which filledthe sky.Deciding what cover story he would tell the others, the Consul paused asecond to look at the sleeping man's face. He glanced up at Hyperionand then moved on.Even if the gravity field had been full Earth standard, the Consul knew,the body in his arms would have been no burden.Once a parent to a child now dead, the Consul walked on, knowing onceagain the sensation of bearing a sleeping son to bed.TWOIt had been a warm, rainy day in Keats, Hyperion's capi-tai, and evenafter the rains stopped a layer of clouds moved slow and heavy over thecity, filling the air with the salt scent of the ocean twenty kilometersto the west.Toward evening, as the gray daylight was beginning to fade into graytwilight, a double sonic boom shook the town and then echoed from thesingle, sculpted peak to the south. The clouds glowed blue-white. Halfa minute later an ebony spacecraft broke through the overcast anddescended carefully on a tail of fusion flame, its navigation lightsblinking red and green against the gray.At one thousand meters the craft's landing beacons flared and threebeams of coherent light from the space-port north of town locked theship in a welcoming ruby tripod. The spacecraft hovered at threehundred meters, slipped sideways as smoothly as a mug sliding on a wettable top, and then settled weightlessly into a waiting blast pit.High-iressure jets of water bathed the pit and the base of the ship,sending up billows of steam to blend with the curtain of drizzle blowingacross the paved plain of the spaceport. When the water jets ceasedthere was no noise except the whisper of rain and the random ticks andcreaks of the cooling spaceshi.A balcony extruded itself from the ship's 'bulkhead twenty meters abovethe pit wail. Five figures emerged.'Thank you for the ride, sir,' Colonel Kassad said to the Consul.The Consul nodded and leaned on the railing, taking in deep breaths offresh air. Droplets of rain beaded on his shoulders and eyebrows.Sol Weintraub lifted his baby from her infant carrier.Some change in pressure, temperature, scent, motion, noise, or acombination of all of these had awakened her and now she began to crylustily. Weintraub bounced her and cooed to her but the wailingcontinued.'An appropriate comment upon our arrival,' said Martin Silenus. Thepoet wore a long purple cape and a red beret which slouched to his rightshoulder. He took a drink from a wineglass he had carried out from thelounge. 'Christ on a stick, this place looks different."The Consul, who had been away only eight local years, had to agree. Thespaceport had been a full nine klicks from the city when he lived inKeats; now shacks, tents, and mud streets surrounded the landing field'sperimeter.In the Consui's day, no more than a ship a week had put in at the tinyspaceport; now he counted more than twenty spacecraft on the field. Thesmall administration and customs building had been superseded by a huge,prefabricated structure, a dozen new blast pits and drop-ship grids hadbeen added where the field had been hastily extended to the west, andthe perimeter now was littered with scores of camouflage-sheathedmodules which the Consul knew must serve as everything from groundcontrol stations to barracks. A forest of exotic antennae grew skywardfrom a cluster of such boxes at the far end of the landing apron.'Progress,' murmured the Consul.'War,' said Colonel Kassad.'Those are people,' said Brawne Lamia, pointing toward the main terminalgates on the south side of the field. A wave of drab colors crashedlike a silent surfagainst the outer fence and the violet containment field.'My God,' said the Consul, 'you're right."Kassad produced his binoculars and they took turns staring at thethousands of forms tugging at the wire, pressing against the repellingfield.'Why are they here?" asked Lamia. 'What do they want?" Even from half akilometer away, the mindless will of the mob was daunting. Dark formsof FORCE: Marines could be seen patrolling just within the perimeter.The Consul realized that between the wire, the containment field, andthe Marines a strip of raw earthalmost surely signified mines or a deathbeam zone, or both.'What do they want?" repeated Lamia.'They want out,' said Kassad.Even before the Colonel spoke, the Consul realized that the shack cityaround the spaceport and the mob at the gates were inevitable; thepeople of Hyperion were ready to leave. He guessed that there must besuch a silent surge toward the gates each time a ship landed.'Well, there's one who'll be staying,' said Martin Silenus and pointedtoward the low mountain across the river to the south. 'Old WeepingWilliam Rex, God rest his sinful soul." The sculpted face of Sad KingBilly was just visible through the light rain and growing darkness.'l knew him. Horatio,' said the drunken poet. 'A man of infinite jest.Not one of them funny. A real horse's ass, Horatio."Sol Weintraub stood just inside the ship, shielding his baby from thedrizzle and removing her cries from the vicinity of the conversation. Hepointed. 'Someone is coming."A groundcar with its camouflage polymer inert and a military EMVmodified with hoverfans for Hyperion's weak magnetic field were crossingthe damp hardpan.Martin Silenus's gaze never left Sad King Billy's dour visage. Silenussaid in a voice almost too soft to be heard:'Deep in the shady sadness of a valeFar sunken from the healthy breath of morn, Far from the fiery noon, andeve's one star, Sat gray-hair'd Saturn, quiet as a stone,Still as the silence round about his lair; Forest on forest hung abovehis headLike cloud on cloud..."Father Hoyt came onto the balcony, rubbing his face with both hands. Hiseyes were wide and unfocused, a child rising from his nap. 'Are wethere?" he asked.'Fucking aye,' cried Martin Silenus, returning the binoculars to theColonel. 'Let's go down and greet'the gendarmes."The young Marine lieutenant seemed unimpressed with the group even afterhe had scanned the authorization wafer Her Masteen had passed along fromthe task force commander. The lieutenant took his time scanning theirvisa chips, letting them wait in the drizzle, occasionally making acomment with the idle arrogance common to such nobodies who have justcome into a small bit of power. Then he came to Fedmahn Kassad's chipand looked up with the expression of a startled stoat. 'ColonelKassad!''Retired,' said Kassad.'l'm sorry, sir,' said the lieutenant, stumbling over his words as hefumbled the visas back to everyone. '1 had no idea you were with thisparty, sir. That is ... the Captain just said... I mean... my unclewas with you on Bressia, sir. I mean, I'm sorry... anything I or mymen can do to..."'At ease, Lieutenant,' said Kassad. 'Is there any chance of gettingsome transport into the city?"'Ah... well, sir..." The young Marine started to rub his chin and thenremembered that he was wearing his helmet. 'Yes, sir. But the problemis, sir, the mobs can get pretty nasty and... well, the damn EMVs don'twork for shit on this. '. uh, pardon me, sir. You see, the groundtransports're limited to cargo and we don't have any skimmers free toleave the base until 2200 hours but I'!1 be happy to get your party onthe roster for..."'Just a minute,' said the Consul. A battered passenger skimmer with thegold geodesic of the Hegemony painted on one flare skirt had landed tenmeters away. A tall, thin man stepped out. 'Theo!" cried the Consul.The two men stepped forward, started to shake hands, and then huggedeach other instead. 'Damn,' said the Consul, 'you look good, Theo."ItWas true. His former aide had gained half a dozen years on theConsul, but the younger man still had the boyish smile, thin face, andthick red hair that had attracted every unmarried woman - annot a fewmarried ones - on the consulate staff. The shyness which had been partof Theo Lane's vulnerability was still there, as evidenced by the way henow needlessly adjusted his archaic horn-rimmed glasses - the youngdiplomat's one affectation.'It's good to have you back,' said Theo.The Consul turned, started to introduce his friend to the group, andthen stopped. 'My God,' he said, 'you're Consul now. I'm sorry, Theo,I wasn't thinking."Theo Lane smiled and adjusted his glasses. 'No problem, sir,' he said.'Actually, l'm no longer Consul. For the last few months I've beenacting Governor-General.The Home Rule council finally requested - and received - formal colonialstatus. Welcome to the newest world in the Hegemony."The Consul stared a second and then hugged his former protg again.'Congratulations, Your Excellency."Theo grinned and glanced at the sky. 'It's going to rain in earnestbefore long. Why don't we get your group aboard the skimmer and VIIdrive you into town." The new Governor-General smiled at the youngMarine.'Lieutenant?"'Uh ... yes, sir?" The officer had snapped to attention.'Could you get your men to load these good people's luggage, please?We'd all like to get in out of the rain."The skimmer flew south above the highway at a steady sixty meters. TheConsul rode in the front passenger seat; the rest of the group relaxedin flowfoam recliners behind. Martin Silenus and Father Hoyt appearedto be asleep. Weintraub's baby had ceased crying in favor of nursing ona soft bottle of synthesized mother's milk.'Things have changed,' said the Consul. He rested his cheek against therain-spattered canopy and looked down at the chaos.Thousand of shacks and iean-tos covered the hillsides and gullies alongthe three-klick ride to the suburbs.Fires were being lighted under wet tarps and the Consul watchedmud-colored figures moving between mud-colored shacks. High fences hadbeen rigged along the old Spaceport Highway and the road itself had beenwidened and regraded. Two lanes of truck and hover traffic,illmost of it military green or shrouded with inactive camouflage polymer,moved sluggishly in both directions.Ahead, the lights of Keats seemed to have multiplied and spread acrossnew sections of the river valley and hills.'Three million,' said Tbeo, as if reading his former boss's mind. 'Atleast three million people and growing every day."The Consul stared. 'There were only four and a half million people onthe planet when I left."'Still are,' said the new Governor-General. 'And every one of themwants to get to Keats, board a ship, and get the hell out. Some arewaiting for the farcaster to be built, but most don't believe it'llhappen in time. They're afraid."'Of the Ousters?"'Them too,' said Theo, 'but mosfiy of the Shrike."The Consul turned his face from the coolness of the canopy. 'It's comesouth of the Bridle Range then?"Theo laughed without humor. 'It's everywhere. Or they're everywhere.Most people are convinced that there are dozens or hundreds of thethings now. Shrike deaths have been reported on all three continents.Everywhere except Keats, segments of the coast along the Mane, and a fewof the big cities like Endymion."'How many casualties?" The Consul did not really want to know.'At least twenty thousand dead or missing,' said Theo.'There are a lot of injured people but that isn't the Shrike, is it?"Again came the dry laugh. 'The Shrike doesn't just wound people, doesit? Uh-uh, people shoot each other by accident, fall down stairways orjump out windows in their panic, and trample each other in crowds. It'sa fucking mess."In the eleven years the Consul had worked with Theo Lane, he had neverheard the younger man use profanity of .any sort. 'Is FORCE any help?"the Consul asked.'Ai'e they what's keeping the Shrike away from the big cities?"Theo shook his head. 'FORCE hasn't done a damn thing except control themobs. Oh, the Marines put on ashow of keeping the spaceport open here and the harbor landing zone atPort R secure, but they haven't even tried to confront the Shrike.They're waiting to fight the Ousters.",'SDF?" asked the Consul, knowing even as he spoke that the poorlytrained Self-defense Force would have been of little use.Theo snorted. 'At least eight thousand of the casualties are SDF.General Braxton took the "Fighting Third" up the River Road to "strikeat the Shrike menace in their lair" and that was the last we heard ofthem."'You're joking,' said the Consul, but one look at his friend's face toldhim that he wasn't. 'Theo,' he said, 'how in the world did you havetime to meet us at the spaceport?"'I didn't,' said the Governor-General. He glanced in the back. Theothers were sleeping or staring exhaustedly out windows. 'I needed totalk to you,' said Theo. 'Convince you not to go."The Consul started to shake his head but Theo grasped his arm, squeezedhard. 'Now listen to what I have to say, damn it. I know how hard itis for you to come back here after... what happened but, goddamn it,there's no sense in your throwing everything away for no reason.Abandon this stupid pilgrimage. Stay in Keats."'I can't..." began the Consul.'Listen to me,' demanded Theo. 'Reason one: you're the finest diplomatand crisis manager I've ever seen andwe need your skills."'It doesn't..."'Shut up a minute. Reason two: you and the others won't get within twohundred klicks of the Time Tombs.Thais isn't like the old days when you were here and the goddamnedsuicides could get up there and even sit around for a week and maybeevenchange their minds andcome home. The Shrike is on the move. It's like a plague." '1understand that but..."'Reason three: lneed you. I begged Tau Ceti Center to' send someoneelse out. When I found that you were coming...well, hell, it got me through the last two years."The Consul shook his head, not understanding.Theo started the turn toward the city center and then hovered, takinghis eyes off the controls to look directly at the Consul. '! want youto take over the governor-generalship.The Senate won't interfere- except perhaps for Gladstone o and by thetime she finds out, it will be too late."The Consul felt as though someone had struck him below the third rib. Helooked away, down at the maze of narrow streets and crooked buildingsthat was Jacktown, the Old City. When he could speak again, he said, 'Ican't, Theo."'Listen, if you..."'No. I mean I cannot. It would be no good if I did accept it, but thesimple truth is, I can't. I have to go on this pilgrimage."Theo straightened his glasses, stared straight ahead.'Look, Theo, you're the most competent and capable Foreign Serviceprofessional l've ever worked with. I've been out of things for eightyears. I think..."Theo nodded tersely, interrupted. 'I suppose you wantto go to the Shrike Temple." ,yes."The skimmer circled and settled. The Consul was staring atnothing,.thinking, when the side doors of the skimmer raised and foldedand Sol Weintraub said, 'Good God."The group stepped out and stared at the charred and toppled wreckage ofwhat had been the Shrike Temple.Since the Time Tombs had been closed as too dangerous some twenty-fivelocal years earlier, the Shrike Temple had become Hyperion's mostpopular tourist attraction.Filling three full city blocks, rising more than a hundred and fiftymeters to its central, sharpened spire, the Shrike Church's centraltemple was part awe-inspiring cathedral, part Gothic joke with itsfluid, buttressed curves of stone permabonded to its whiskered-alloyskeleton, part Escher print with its tricks of perspective andimpossible angles, part Boschian nightmare with its tunnel entrances,hidden chambers, dark gardens, and forbidden sections, and - more thananything else - it had been part of Hyperion's past.Now it was gone. Tall heaps of blackened stone were the only hint ofthe structure's former majesty. Melted alloy girders rose from thestones like the ribs of some giant carcass. Much of the rubble hadtumbled into the pits, basements, and passages which had lain beneaththe three-century-old landmark. The Consul walked close to the edge ofa pit and wondered if the deep basements had - as legend decreed -actually connected to one of the planet's labyrinths.'It looks as if they used a hellwhip on this place,' said MartinSilenus, using an archaic term for any high-energy laser weapon. Thepoet seemed suddenly sobered as he joined the Consul at the edge of thepit. 'I remember when the Temple and parts of the Old City were theonly things here,' he said. 'After the disaster near the Tombs, Billydecided to relocate Jacktown here becauseof the Temple. Now it's gone. Christ."'No,' said Kassad.The others looked at him.The Colonel rose from where he had been examining the rubble. 'Not ahellwhip,' he said. 'Shaped plasma charges. Several of them."'Now do you want to stay here and go on this useless pilgrimage?" askedTheo. 'Come with me back to the consulate." He was speaking to theConsul but extending the invitation to everyone.The Consul turned away from the pit, looking at his former aide but nowseeing, for the first time, the Governor-General of a besieged Hegemonyworld. 'We can't, Your Excellency,' said the Consul. 'At least Ican't. I won't speak for the others."The four men and the woman shook their heads.Silenus and Kassad began unloading luggage. The rain returned as alight mist falling out of the darkness. At that second the Consulnoticed the two FORCE attack skimmers hovering above the nearbyroofiops. Darkness and chameleon-polymer hulls had hidden them we!!,but the rain now revealed their outlines. Of course, thoughtthe Consul, the Governor-General does not travel unescorted.'Did the priests escape? Were there survivors when theTemple was destroyed?" asked Brawne Lamia.'Yes,' said Theo. The de facto dictator of five million doomed soulsremoved his glasses and dried them on his shirttail. 'All of the ShrikeCult priests and acolytes escaped through tunnels. The mob had beensurrounding this place for months. Their leader, a woman named Cammonfrom somewhere east of the Sea of Grass, gave everyone in the Templeplenty of warning before they set off. the DL-20."'Where were the police?" asked the Consul. 'The SDF?FORCE?"Theo Lane smiled and at that second he looked decades older than theyoung man the Consul had known.'You folks have been in transit for three years,' he said.'The universe has changed. Shrike cultists are being burned out andbeaten up in the Web. You can imagine the attitude here. The Keatspolice have been absorbed under the martial law I declared fourteenmonths ago.They and the SDF watched while the mob torched the Temple. So did 1.There were half a million people here that night."Sol Weintraub stepped closer. 'Do they know about us? About this finalpilgrimage?"'If they did,' said Theo, 'none of you would be alive.You'd think they'd welcome anything that might appease the Shrike, butthe only thing the mob would notice is that you were chosen by theShrike Church. As it was, I had to overrule my own Advisory Council.They were in favor of destroying your ship before it reached theatmosphere."'Why did you?" asked the Consul. 'Overrule them, 1 mean. 'Theo sighed and adjusted his glasses. 'Hyperion still needs theHegemony, and Gladstone still has the vote of confidence of the AllThing, if not the Senate. And I still need you."The Consul looked at the rubble of the Shrike Temple.'This pilgrimage was over before you got here,' said Governor-GeneralTheo Lane. 'Will you come back to the consulate with me ... at leastin an advisory capacity?"'I'm sorry,' said the Consul. '1 can't."Theo turned without a word, dropped into the skimmer, and lifted off.His military escort followed as a blur in the rain.It was raining harder now. The group moved closer together in thegrowing darkness. Weintraub had rigged a makeshift hood over Rachel andthe noise of the rain on plastic made the baby cry.'What now?" said the Consul, looking around at the night and narrowstreets. Their luggage lay heaped in a soggy pile. The world smelledof ashes.Martin Silenus grinned. 'I know a bar."It turned out that the Consul also knew the bar; he had all but lived inCicero's for most of his eleven-year assignment on Hyperion.Unlike most things in Keats, on Hyperion, Cicero's was not named aftersome piece of pre-Hegira literary trivia. Rumor had it that the bar wasnamed after a section of an Old Earth city - some said Chicago, USA,others were sure it was Calcutta, AIS - but only Stan Leweski, owner andgreat-grandson of the founder, knew for sure, and Stan had neverrevealed its secret.The bar itself had overflowed over the century and a half of itsexistence from a walkup loft in one of Jacktown's sagging olderbuildings along the Hoolie River to nine levels in four sagging oldbuildings along the Hoolie. The only consistent elements of decor atCicero's over the decades were the low ceilings, thick smoke, andconstant background babble which offered a sense of privacy in the midstof bustle.There was no privacy this night. The Consul and the others paused asthey carried their gear through the Marsh Lane entrance.'Jesus Wept,' muttered Martin SilenusCicero's looked as if it had been invaded by barbarian hordes. Everychair was filled, every table occupied, mostly by men, and the floorswere littered with packs, weapons, bedrolls, antiquated comm equipment,ration boxes, and all of the other detritus of an army of refugees...or perhaps a refugee army. The heavy air ofCicero's, which once had been filled with the blended scent of broilingsteaks, wine, stim, ale, and T-free tobacco, was now laden with theoverlapping smells of unwashed bodies, urine, and hopelessness.At that moment the huge form of Stan Leweski materialized out of thegloom. The bar owner's forearms were as huge and heavy as ever, but hisforehead had advanced more than a few centimeters against the recedingtangle of black hair and there were more creases than the Consulremembered around the dark eyes.Those eyes were wide now as Leweski stared at the Consul. 'Ghost,' hesaid."No."'You are not dead?"'No."'By damn!" declared Stan Leweski and, grasping the Consul by the upperarms, picked him up as easily as a man would lift a five-year-old. 'Bydamn! You are not dead. What are you doing here?"'Checking your liquor license,' said the Consul. 'Put me down."Leweski carefully set the Consul down, tapped his shoulders, andgrinned. He looked at Martilt Silenus and the grin changed to a frown.'You look familiar but I have never seen you before."'I knew your great*grandfather,' said Silenus. 'Which reminds me, doyou have any of that pre-Hegira ale left?The warm, 'British stuff that tastes like recycled moose piss. I couldnever get enough of that."'Nothing left,' said Leweski. He pointed at the poet.'By damn. Grandfather Jiri's trunk. That old holo of the satyr in theoriginal Jacktown. Can it be?" He stared at Silenus and then at theConsul, touching them both gingerly with a massive forefinger. 'Twoghosts."'Six tired people,' said the Consul. The baby began crying again.'Seven. Do you have space for us?"Leweski turned in a half circle, hands spread, palms up. 'it is alllike this. No space left. No food. No wine." He squinted at MartinSilenus. 'No ale. Now we have become a big hotel with no beds. TheSDF bastards stay here without paying and drink their own upcountryrotgut and wait for the world to end. That will happen soon enough, Ithink."The group was standing in what had once been the entrance mezzanine.Their heaped luggage joined a riot of gear already littering the floor.Small clusters of men shouldered their way through the throng and castappraising glances at the newcomers- especially at Brawne Lamia. Shereturned their stares with a flat, cold glare.Stan Leweski looked at the Consul for a moment. '1 have a balconytable. Five of those SDF Death Commandos have been parked there for aweek, telling everyone and each other how they are going to wipe out theOuster Legions with their bare hands. You want the'table, I willthrow the teat-suckers out."'Yes,' said the Consul.Leweski had turned to leave when Lamia stopped him with a hand on hisarm. 'Would you like a little help?" she asked.Stan Leweski shrugged, grinned. 'I do not need it, but I might like it.Come."They disappeared into the crowd.The third-floor balcony had just enough room for the splintered tableand six chairs. Despite the insane crowding on the main floors, stairs,and landings, no one had challenged them for the space after Leweski andLamia threw the protesting Death Commandos over the railing and into theriver nine meters below. Somehow Leweski had managed to send up atankard of beer and a basket of bread and cold beef.The group ate in silence, obviously suffering more than the usual amountof post fugue hunger, fatigue, and depression. The darkness of thebalcony was relieved only by dim, reflected light from deeper withinCicero's and by the lanterns on passing river barges. Most of thebuildings along the Hoolie were dark but other city lights reflectedfrom low clouds. The Consul could make out the ruins of the ShrikeTemple half a kilometer upriver.'Well,' said Father Hoyt, obviously recovered from the heavy dose ofultramorph and teetering on thedelicate balance between pain and sedation, 'what do we do next?"When no one answered, the Consul closed his eyes. He refused to takethe lead in anything. Sitting on the balcony at Cicero's, it was alltoo easy to fall back into the rhythms of a former life; he would drinkuntil the early morning hours, watch the predawn meteor showers as theclouds cleared, and then stagger to his empty apartment near the market,going into the consulate four hours later showered, shaved, andseemingly human except for the blood in his eyes and the insane ache inhis skull. Trusting in Theo - quiet, efficient Theo - to get himthrough the morning. Trusting in luck to get him through the day.Trusting in the drinking at Cicero's to get him through the night.Trusting in the unimportance of his posting to get him through life.'You are all ready to leave for the pilgrimage?"The Consul's eyes snapped open. A hooded figure stood in the doorwayand for a second the Consul thought it was Het Masteen, but then herealized that this man was much shorter, his voice not accented with thestilted Templar consonants.'If you are ready, we must go,' said the dark figure.'Who are you?" asked Brawne Lamia.'Come quickly,' was the shadow's only reply.Fedmahn Kassad stood, bending to keep his head from striking theceiling, and detained the robed figure, flipping back the man's hoodwith a flick of his left hand.'An android!" said Lenar Hoyt, staring at the man's blue skin andblue-on-blue eyes.The Consul was less surprised. For more than a century it had beenillegal to own androids in the Hegemony, and none had been biofacturedfor almost that long, but they were still used for manual labor inremote parts of backwater, noncolony worlds - worlds like Hyperion. TheShrike Temple had used androids extensively, complying with the Churchof the Shrike doctrine which proclaimed that androids were free fromoriginal sin, therefore spiritually superior to humankind and-incidentally-exempt from the Shrike's terrible and inevitableretribution.'You must come quickly,' whispered the android, setting his hood inplace.'Are you from the Temple?" asked Lamia.'Quiet!" snapped the android. He glanced into the hall, turned back,and nodded. 'We must hurry. Please follow me."All of them stood and then hesitated. The Consul watched as Kassadcasually unsealed the long leather jacket he was wearing. He caught thebriefest glimpse of a deathwand tucked in the Colonei's belt. Normallythe Consul would have been appalled by even the thought of a deathwandnearby- the slighttest mistaken touch could pure every synapse on thebalcony - but at thismoment he was oddly reassured by the sight of it.'Our luggage..." began Weintraub.'It has been seen to,' whispered the hooded man.'Quickly now."The group followed the android down the stairs and into the night, theirmovement as tired and passive as a sigh.The Consul slept late. Half an hour after sunrise a rectangle of lightfound its way between the porthole's shutters and fell across hispillow. The Consul rolled away and did not wake. An hour after thatthere came a loud clatter as the tired mantas which had pulled the bargeall night were released and fresh ones harnessed. The Consul slept on.In the next hour the footsteps and cries of the crew on the deck outsidehis stateroom grew louder and more persistent, but it was the warningklaxon below the locks at Karla which finally brought him up out of hissleep.Moving slowly in the druglike languor of fugue hangover, the Consulbathed as best he could with only basin and pump, dressed in loosecotton trousers, an old canvas shirt, and foam-soled walking shoes, andfound his way to the mid-deck.Breakfast had been set out on a long sideboard near a weathered tablewhich could be retracted into the deck planking. An awning shaded theeating area and the crimson and gold canvas snapped to the breeze oftheirpassage. It was a beautiful day, cloudless and bright, with Hyperion'ssun making up in ferocity what it lacked in size.M. Weintraub, Lamia, Kassad, and Silenus had been up for some time.Lenar Hoyt and Het Masteen joined the group a few minutes after theConsul arrived.The Consul helped himself to toasted fish, fruit, and orange juice atthe buffet and then moved to the railing.The water was wide here, at least a kilometer from shore to shore, andits green and lapis sheen echoed the sky. At first glance the Consuldid not recognize the land on either side of the river. To the east,periscope-bean paddies stretched away into the haze of distance wherethe rising sun reflected on a thousand flooded surfaces.A few indigenie huts were visible at the junction of paddy dikes, theirangled walls made of bleached weirwood or golden half oak. To the west,the bottomland along the river was overgrown with low tangles of gissen,woman-grove root, and a flamboyant red fern the Consul did notrecognize, all growing around mud marshes and miniature lagoons whichstretched another kilometer or so to bluffs where scrub everblues clungto any bare spot between granite slabs.For a second the Consul felt lost, disoriented on a world he thought heknew well, but then he remembered the klaxon at the Karla Locks andrealized that they had entered a rarely used stretch of the Hoolie northof Doukhobor's Copse. The Consul had never seen this part of the river,having always traveled on or flown above the Royal Transport Canal whichlay to the west of the bluffs. He could only surmise that some dangeror disturbance along the main route to the Sea of Grass had sent themthis back way along bypassed stretches of the Hoolie. He guessed thatthey were about a hundred and eighty kilometers northwest of Keats.'It looks different in the daylight, doesn't it?" said Father Hoyt.The Consul looked at the shore again, not sure what Hoyt was talkingabout; then he realized the priest meant the barge.It had been strange - following the android messengerin the rain, boarding the old barge, making their way through its mazeof tessellated rooms and passages, picking up Het Masteen at the ruinsof the Temple, and then watching the lights of Keats fall astern.The Consul remembered those hours before and after midnight as from afatigue-blurred dream, and he imagined the others must have been just asexhausted and disoriented. He vaguely remembered his surprise that thebarge's crew were all android, but mostly he recalled his relief atfinally closing the door of his stateroom and crawling into bed.'l was talking to A. Bettik this morning,' said Weintraub, referring tothe android who had been their guide. 'This old scow has quite ahistory."Martin Silenus moved to the sideboard to pour himself more tomato juice,added a dash of something from the flask he carried, and said, 'It'sobviously been around a bit. The goddamn railings've been oiled byhands, the stairs worn by feet, the ceilings darkened by lamp soot, andthe beds beaten saggy by generations of humping.I'd say it's several centuries old. The carvings and rococo finishesare fucking marvelous. Did you notice that under all the other scentsthe inlaid wood still smells of sandalwood? I wouldn't be surprised ifthis thing came from Old Earth."'It does,' said Sol Weintraub. The baby, Rachel, slept on his arm,softly blowing bubbles of saliva in her sleep.'We're on the proud ship Benares, built in and named after the Old Earthcity of the same name."'I don't remember hearing of any Old Earth city with that name,' saidthe Consul.Brawne Lamia looked up from the last of her breakfast.'Benares, also known as Varanasi or Gandhipur, Hindi Free State. Partof the Second Asian Co-prosperity Sphere after the Third Sino-JapaneseWar.Destroyed in the lndo-Soviet Muslim Republic Limited Exchange."'Yes,' said Weintraub, 'the Benares was built quite some time before theBig Mistake. Mid-twenty-second century, I would guess. A. Bettikinforms me that it was originally a levitation barge..."'Are the EM generators still down there?" interrupted Colonel Kassad.'1 believe so,' said Weintraub. 'Next to the main salon on the lowestdeck. The floor of the salon is clear lunar crystal. Quite nice if wewere cruising at two thousand meters... quite useless now."'Benares,' mused Martin Silenus. He ran his hand lovingly across atime-darkened railing. 'I was robbed there once."Brawne Lamia put down her coffee mug. 'Old man, are you trying to tellus that you're ancient enough to remember Old Earth? We're not fools,you know."'My dear child,' beamed Martin Silenus, 'I am not trying to tell youanything. I just thought it might be entertaining - as well as edifyingand enlightening - if at some point we exchanged lists of all thelocations at which we have either robbed or been robbed. Since you havethe unfair advantage of having been the daughter of a senator, 1 am surethat your list would be much more distinguished... and much longer."Lamia opened her mouth to retort, frowned, and said nothing."i wonde how this ship got to Hyperion?" murmured Father Hoyt. 'Whybring a levitation barge to a world where EM equipment doesn't work?"'It would work,' said Colonel Kassad. 'Hyperion has some magneticfield. It just would not be reliable in holding anything airborne."Father Hoyt raised an eyebrow, obviously at a loss to see thedistinction.'Hey,' cried the poet from his place at the railing, 'the gang's allhere!''So?" said Brawne Lamia. Her lips all but disappeared into a thin linewhenever she spoke to Silenus.'So we're all here,' he said. 'Let's get on with the storytelling."Het Masteen said, '1 thought it had been agreed that we would tell ourrespective stories after the dinner hour."Martin Silenus shrugged. 'Breakfast, dinner, who thefuck cares? We're assembled. It's not going to take six or seven daysto get to the Time Tombs, is it?"The Consul considered. Less than two days to get as far as the rivercould take them. Two more days, or less if the winds were right, on theSea of Grass. Certainly no more than one more day to cross themountains. 'No,' he said. 'Not quite six days.'All right,' said Silenus, 'then let's get on with the telling of tales.Besides, there's no guarantee that the Shrike won't come calling beforeWe knock on his door.If these bedtime stories are supposed to be helpful to our survivalchances in some way, then I say let's hear from everyone before thecontributors start getting chopped and diced by that ambulatory foodprocessor we're so eager to visit."'You're disgusting,' said Brawne Lamia.'Ah, darling,' smiled Silenus, 'those are the same words you whisperedlast night after your second orgasm."Lamia looked away. Father Hoyt cleared his throat and said, 'Whose turnis it? To tell a story, I mean?" The silence stretched.'Mine,' said Fedmahn Kassad. The tall man reached into the pocket ofhis white tunic and held up a slip of paper with a large 2 scribbled onit.'Do you mind doing this now?" asked Sol Weintraub.Kassad showed a hint of a smile. 'I wasn't'in favor of doing it atall,' he said, 'but if it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well itwere done quickly."'Hey!" cried Martin Silenus. 'The man knows his pre-Hegiraplaywrights."'Shakespeare?" said Father Hoyt.'No,' said Silenus. 'Lerner and fucking Lowe. Neii buggering Simon.Hamel fucking Posten."'Colonel,' Sol Weintraub said formally, 'the weather is nice, none of usseems to have anything pressing to do in the next hour or so, and wewould be obliged if you would share the tale of what brings you toHyperion on the Shrike's last pilgrimage."Kassad nodded. The day grew warmer as the canvas awning snapped, thedecks creaked, and the levitationbarge Benares worked its steady way upstream toward the mountains, themoors, and the Shrike.THE SOLDIER'S TALE: The War LoversIt was during the Battle of Agincourt that Fedmahn Kassad encounteredthe woman he would spend the rest of his life seeking.It was a wet and chilly late October morning in A.D.1415. Kassad had been inserted as an archer into the army of Henry V ofEngland. The English force had been on French soil since August 14 andhad been retreating from superior French forces since October 8.Henry had convinced his War Council that the army could bent the Frenchin a forced march to the safety of Calais. They had failed. Now, asOctober 25 dawned gray and drizzly, seven thousand Englishmen, mostlybowmen, faced a force of some twenty-eight thousand French men-at-armsacross a kilometer of muddy field. 'Kassad was cold, tired sick, and scared. He and the other archers hadbeen surviving on little more than scavenged berries for the past weekof the march and almost every man on the line that morning was sufferingfrom diarrhea. The air temperature was in the low fifties Fahrenheitand Kassad had spent a long night trying to sleep on damp ground. Hewas impressed with the unbelievable realism of the experience- theOlympus Command School Historical Tactical Network was as far beyondregular stimsims as full-form holos were beyond tintypes - but thephysical sensations were so convincing, so real, that Kassad did notrelish the thought of being wounded. There were tales of cadetsreceiving fatal wounds in the OCS:HTN sims and being pulled dead fromtheir immersion creches.Kassad and the other bowmen on Henry's right flank had been staring atthe larger French force for most of the morning when pennants waved, thefifteenth-century equivalent of sergeants brayed, and the archers obeyedthe King's command and began marching against theenemy. The ragged English line, stretching about seven hundred metersacross the field from treeline to treeline, consisted of clusters ofarchers like Kassad's troop interspersed with smaller groups ofmen-at-arms. The English had no formal cavalry and most of the horsesKassad could see on his end of the field were carrying men clusterednear the King's command group three hundred meters toward the center, orhuddled around the Duke of York's position much closer to where Kassadand the other archers stood near the right flank. These command groupsreminded Kassad of a FORCE:ground mobile staff HQ, only instead of theinevitable forest of comm antennae giving away their position, brightbanners and pennants hung limp on pikes. An obvious artillery target,thought Kassad, and then reminded himself that this particular militarynuance did not yet exist.Kassad noticed that the French had plenty of horses.He estimated six or seven hundred mounted men formed in ranks on each ofthe French flanks and a long line of cavalry behind the main battleline. Kassad did not like horses. He had seen holos and pictures, ofcourse, but he had not encountered the animals themselves until thisexercise, and the size, smell, and sound of them tended to be unnerving- especially so when the damn quadrupeds were armored chest and head,shod in steel, and trained to carry armored men wielding four meters oflance.The English advance halted. Kassad estimated that his battle line wasabout two hundred and fifty meters from the French. He knew from theexperience of the past week that this was within longbow range, but healso knew that he would have to pull his arm half out of its socket tohold the pull.The French were shouting what Kassad assumed were insults. He ignoredthem as he and his silent comrades stepped forward from where they hadplanted their long arrows and found soft ground in which to drive theirstakes. The stakes were long and heavy and Kassad had been carrying hisfor a week. Almost a meter and a half long, the clumsy thing had beensharpened at both ends.When the order first came down for all archers to find saplings and cutstakes, somewhere in the deep woodsjust after they had crossed the Somme, Kassad had wondered idly what thethings were for. Now he knew.Every third archer carried a heavy mallet nnd now they took tums drivingtheir stakes in at a careful angle.Kassad pulled out his long knife, resharpened the end which, evenleaning, rose almost to his chest, and stepped back through the hedgehogof sharpened stakes to await the French charge.The French did not charge.Kassad waited with the others. His bow was strung, forty-eight arrowswere planted in two clusters at hisfeet, and his feet were set properly.The French did not charge.The rain had stopped but a cool breeze had come up and what little bodyheat Kassad had generated by the short march and the task of drivingstakes had been lost quickly. The only sounds were the metallicshufflings of men and horses, occasional mutterings or nervous laughs,and the heavier thud of hooves as the French cavalry rearranged itselfbut still refused to charge.'Fuck this,' said a gri,.led yeoman a few feet from Kassad. 'Thosebastards've wasted our whole bleeding morning. They'd better piss orget off the pot."Kassad nodded. He was not sure if he was hearing and understandingMiddle English or if the sentence had been in simple Standard. He hadno idea if the grizzled archer was another Command School cadet, aninstructor, or merely an artifact of the sire. He could not guess ifthe slang had been correct. He did not care. His heart was poundingand his palms were sweaty. He wiped his hands on his jerkin.As if King Henry had taken his cue from the old man's muttering, commandflags suddenly bobbed and rose, sergeants screamed, and row upon row ofEnglish archers raised their longbows, pulled when commands wereshouted, released on the next command.Four waves of arrows comprised of more than six thousand meter-long,chisel-pointed, clothyard missiles rose, seemed to hang in a cloudthirty meters up, and fell on the French.There came the sound of horses screaming and athousand demented children pounding on ten thousand tin pots as theFrench men-at-arms leaned into the rain of arrows to let their steelhelmets and their chest and shoulder armor take the brunt of thedownpour. Kassad knew that in military terms little real damage hadbeen done, but this was small solace to the occasional French soldierwith ten inches of arrow through his eye, or to the scores of horsesleaping, tumbling, and crashing into one another while their ridersstruggled to remove woodenshafts from the creatures' backs and flanks.The French did not charge.More commands were shouted. Kassad raised, read-led, loosed his arrow.Again. And again. The sky darkened every ten seconds. Kassad's armand back ached from the punishing rhythm. He found that he felt neitherelation nor anger. He was doing his job. His forearm was raw. Againthe arrows flew. And again. Fifteen of his first sheaf of twenty-fourarrows were gone when a cry went up along the English line and Kassadpaused and glanced down while holding full pull.The French were charging.A cavalry charge was something beyond Kassad's experience.Watching twelve hundred armored horses charging directly at him createdinternal sensations which Kassad found a bit unnerving. The charge tookless than forty seconds but Kassad discovered that this was ample timefor his mouth to go absolutely dry, his breathing to begin to haveproblems, and for his testicles to retreat completely into his body. Ifthe rest of Kassad could have found a comparable hiding place, he wouldhave seriously considered crawling into it.As it was, he was too busy to run.Firing on command, his line of archers got off five flat volleys at theattacking horsemen, managed one more shot in independent fire, and thenthey fell back five paces.Horses, it turned out, were too smart to willingly impale themselvesupon stakes- no matter how hard their human riders implored them to doso- but the second and third waves of cavalry did not stop asabruptly as the first, and in a single mad moment horses were down andscreaming, riders were thrown and screaming, and Kassad was out andscreaming, rushing at every downed Frenchman he could see, wielding amallet on the prostrate form when he could, slashing through gaps inarmor with his long knife when it was too crowded to swing the mallet.Soon he and the grizzled archer and a younger man who had lost his capbecame an efficient killing team, closing in on a downed rider fromthree sides, Kassad using the mallet to knock the pleading horseman offhis knees, then all three moving in with their blades.Only one knight gained his feet and raised a sword to confront them. TheFrenchman flipped up his visor and called out a clear request for honorand single combat.The old man and the youth circled like wolves. Kassad returned with hisbow and put an arrow into the knight's left eye from ten paces.The battle continued in the deadly comic-opera vein common to all armedcombat since the first rock and thighbone duels on Old Earth. TheFrench cavalry managed to turn and flee just as the first wave of tenthousand men-at-arms charged the English center on foot.The melee broke up the rhythm of the attack and, by the time the Frenchhad regained their initiative, Henry's own men-at-arms had braced tohold them at pike length while Kassad and several thousand other archerspoured volley fire into the massed French infantry at close range.That did not end the battle. It was not necessarily even the decisivemoment. The turning point, when it came, was lost - as all such momentsare - within the dust and turmoil of a thousand individual encounterswhere infantrymen faced infantrymen across the distance of theirpersonal weapons. Before it was over some three hours later there wouldbe minor variations on repeated themes, ineffective thrusts and clumsycounterthrusts, and a less than honorable moment when Henry would orderprisoners killed rather than leave them in the rear when the Englishwere confronted with a new threat. But the heralds and historians wouldlater agree that theoutcome had been sealed somewhere in the confusion during the firstFrench infantry charge. The French died in their thousands. Englishdominion on that part of the Continent would continue for a while. Theday of the armored man-at-arms, the knight, the embodiment of chivalry, was over - hammered into history's coffin by a few thousandragtag peasant archers carrying longbows.The ultimate insult to the noble-born French dead - if the dead indeedcould be further insulted - lay in the fact that the English archerswere not only common men, common in the lowest, most flea-infested senseof the word, but that they were draftees. Doughboys. Gls.Grunts. AIPs. Spezzes. K-techs. Jump Rats.But all that was in the lesson Kassad was supposed to have learnedduring the OCS:HTN exercise. He learned none of it. He was too busyhaving an encounter which would change his life.The French man-at-arms went over the head of his falling horse, rolledonce, and was up and running for the woods before the mud quit flying.Kassad followed. He was halfway to the tree line before he realizedthat the youth and the griTsled archer had not come with him. It didnot matter. Kassad's adrenaline was flowing and the bloodlust had himin its grip.The man-at-arms, who had just been thrown to the ground from a horsemoving at full gallop and who was wearing sixty pounds of clumsy armor,should have been an easy prey to catch. He was not. The Frenchmanglanced back once, saw Kassad coming on a full run with a mallet in hishand and his eye full of business, and then the man-at-arms shifted intoa higher gear and reached the trees fifteen meters ahead of his pursuer.Kassad was deep into the woods before he stopped, leaned on the mallet,gasped, and considered his position.Thuds, screams, and crashes from the battlefield behind him were muffledby distance and shrubbery.The trees were almost bare and still dripped from the rainstorm thenight before; the floor of the forest was carpeted with a thick layer ofold leaves and a snarl of shrubs and brambles. The man-at-arms had lefta trail ofbroken branches and footprints for the first twenty meters or so, butnow deer trails and overgrown paths made it difficult to see where hehad passed.Kassad moved slowly, stepping deeper into the woods, trying to be alertfor any noise above the sound of his own panting and the insane poundingof his heart. It occurred to Kassad that, tactically speaking, this wasnot a brilliant move; the man-at-arms had been wearing full armor andcarrying his sword when he disappeared in the bushes. At any moment theFrenchman might forget his panic, regret his temporary loss of honor,and remember his years of combat training. Kassad also had beentrained. He looked down at his cloth shirt and leather vest. Themallet was still in his hands, the knife in his broad belt. He had beentrained to use high-energy weapons with a killing range of a few metersto thousands of kilometers. He had been rated in plasma grenades,he!l-whips, fleschette rifles, sonics, recoilless zero-gravity weapons,deathwands, kinetic assault guns, and beam gauntlets. He now had aworking knowledge of an English longbow. None of these objects-including the longbow - was on his person at the moment.'Ah, shit,' murmured Second Lieutenant Kassad.The man-at-arms came out of the bushes like a charging bear, arms up,legs apart, the sword coming around in a flat arc meant to disembowelKassad. The OCS cadet tried to leap back and raise his mallet at thesame time.Neither effort was completely successful. The Frenchman's sword knockedthe heavy mallet out of Kassad's grip while the dull point of the bladeslashed through leather, shirt, and skin. Kassad bellowed and stumbled backward again, tugging at the knife in hisbelt. His right heel caught the branch of a fallen tree and he wentdown backward, cursing and rolling deeper into the tangle of branches asthe man-at-arms crashed forward, his heavy sword clearing limbs like anoversized machete. Kassad had his knife out by the time the man=at-armshad cleared a path through the deadfall, but the ten-inch blade was apitiful thing against armor unless the knight was helpless. This knightwas not helpless. Kassad knew that he wouldnever get inside the arc of sword blade. His only hope was in running,but the tall trunk of the fallen tree behind him and the deadfall beyondeliminated that option. He did not wish to get cut down from behind ashe turned.Nor from below as he climbed. Kassad did not wish to be cut down fromany angle.Kassad went into a knife fighter's crouch which he hadn't used since hisstreet-fighting days in the Tharsis slums. He wondered how thesimulation would deal with his death.The figure appeared behind the man-at-arms like a sudden shadow. Thenoise of Kassad's mallet striking the knight's armored shoulder soundedprecisely like someone bashing the hood of an EMV with a sledge-hammer.The Frenchman staggered, turned to meet the new threat, and took asecond mallet below in the chest.Kassad's savior was small; the man-at-arms did not go down. The Frenchknight was raising his sword above his head when Kassad hit him behindand below the knees with a shoulder tackle.Tree limbs snapped as the Frenchman went down. The small attacker stoodastride the knight, pinning the armored man's sword arm with one footwhile bringing the mallet down repeatedly onto helmet and visor.Kassad extricated himself from the tangle of legs and branches, sat onthe downed man's knees, and began slashing through gaps in armor atgroin, sides, and underarms. Kassad's rescuer jumped aside to plantboth feet on the knight's wrist and Kassad scrambled forward, stabbingthrough crevices where the helmet met chest armor, finally slamming theblade through slits in the visor itself.The knight screamed as the mallet came down a final time, almostcatching Kassad's hand as the hammer drove the blade through the visorslit like a ten-inch tent peg. The man-at-arms arched,'lifting Kassadand sixty pounds of armor clear of the ground in a final violent spasmand then fell back limply.Kassad rolled onto his side. His rescuer collapsed beside him. Bothwere covered with sweat and the deadman's blood. Kassad looked at his savior. The woman was dressed inclothes not dissimilar to Kassad's. For a moment they merely lay thereand gasped for air.'Are you... all fight?" Kassad managed after a while.He was suddenly struck by her appearance. Her brown hair was short bycurrent Worldweb fashion, short and straight and cut so that the longeststrands fell from the part, just a few centimeters left of the center ofher forehead, to just above her right ear. It was a boy's haircut fromsome forgotten time, but she was no boy. Kassad thought that she wasperhaps the most beautiful woman he had ever seen: bone structure soperfect that chin and cheekbones were shaped without being too sharp,large eyes glowing with life and intelligence, a gentle mouth with asoft underlip. Lying next to her, Kassad realized that she was tall -not so tall as he but obviously not a woman from the fifteenth century -and even under her of the tunic and baggy trousers he could see the softswell of hipg and breast. She appeared to be a few years older thanKassad, perhaps in her late twenties, but this fact barely registered asshe continued staring into his face with those soft, beguiling,endlessly deep eyes.'Are you all right?" he asked again. His voice sounded strange, even tohimself.She did not answer. Or, rather, she answered by sliding long fingersacross Kassad's chest, ripping away the leather thongs which bound therough vest. Her hands found his shirt. It was soaked with blood andripped halfway down the front. The woman ripped it open the rest Of theway. She moved against him now, her fingers and lips on his chest, hipsalready beginning to move.Her fight hand found the cords to his trouser front, ripped them free.Kassad helped her pull off the rest of his clothes, removed hers withthree fluid movements. She wore nothing under her shirt andcoarse-cloth trousers.Kassad's hand slid between her thighs, behind her, cupped her movingbuttocks, pulled her closer, and slid to the moist roughness in front.She opened to him, her mouth closing on his. Somehow, with all of theirmotion and disrobing, their skin never lost contact. Kassad felthis own excitement rubbing against the cusp of her belly.She rolled above him then, her thighs astride his hips, her gaze stilllocked with his. Kassad had never been so excited. He gasped as herright hand went behind her, found him, guided him into her. When heopened his eyes again she was moving slowly, her head back, eyes closed.Kassad's hands moved up her sides to cup her perfect breasts. Nippleshardened against his palms.They made love then. Kassad, at twenty-three standard years, had beenin love once and had enjoyed sex many times. He thought he knew the wayand the why of it. There was nothing in his experience to that momentwhich he could not have described with a phrase and a laugh to hissquadmates in the hold of a troop transport.With the calm, sure cynicism of a twenty-three-year-old veteran he wassure that he would never experience anything that could not be sodescribed, so dismissed. He was wrong. He could never adequately sharethe sense of the next few minutes with anyone else. He would never try.They made love in a sudden shaft of late October light with a carpet ofleaves and clothes beneath them and a film of blood and sweat oiling thesweet friction between them. Her green eyes stared down at Kassad,widening slightly when he began moving quickly, closing at the samesecond he closed his.They moved together then in the sudden tide of sensation as old andinevitable as the movement of worlds: pulses racing, flesh quickeningwith its own moist purposes, a further, final rising together, the worldreceding to nothing at all - and then, still joined by touch andheartbeat and the fading thrill of passion, allowing consciousness toslide back to separate flesh while the world flowed in through forgottensenses.They lay next to each other. The dead man's armor was cold againstKassad's left, arm, her thigh warm against his right leg. The sunlightwas a benediction.Hidden colors rose to the surface of things. Kassad turned his head andgazed at her as she rested her head on his shoulder. Her cheeksglowed with flush and autumn light and her hair lay like copper threadsalong the fleshof his arm. She curved her leg over his thigh and Kassad felt theclockwise stirring of renewed passion. The sun was warm on his face. Heclosed his eyes.When he awoke she was gone. He was certain that only seconds had passed- no more than a minute, certainly -but the sunlight was gone, colorshad flowed out of the forest, and a cool evening breeze moved barebranches.Kassad dressed in torn clothes made stiff with blood.The French man-at-arms lay still and rigid in the unselfconsciousattitude of death. He already seemed inanimate, a part of the forest.There was no sign whatsoever of the woman.Fedmahn Kassad !imPed his way back through the woods, evening gloom, anda sudden, chilling drizzle.The battlefield still held people, living and dead. The dead lay inheaps like the piles of toy soldiers Kassad had played with as a child.Wounded men moved slowly with the help of friends. Here and therefurtive forms picked their way among the dead, and near the oppositetree line a lively group of heralds, both French and English, met inconclave with much pointing and animated conversation.Kassad knew that they had to decide upon a name for the battle so thattheir respective records would agree. He also knew that they wouldsettle on the name of the nearest castle, Agincourt, even though it hadfigured in neither strategy nor battle.Kassad was beginning to think that this was no simulation, that his lifein the Worldweb was the dream and that this gray day had to be reality,when suddenly the entire scene froze with outlines of human figures,horses, and the darkening forest becoming as transparent as a fadingholo. And then Kassad was being helPed out of his simulation creche atthe Olympus Command School and the other cadets and instructors wererising, talking, laughing with one another - all seemingly unaware thatthe world had changed forever.For weeks Kassad sPent every free hour wandering the Command Schoolgrounds, watching from the ramparts as the evening shadow of MonsOlympus covered firstthe Plateau forest, then the heavily settled highlands, then everythinghalfway to the horizon, and then all the world. And every second hethought about what had hapPened. He thought about her.No one else had noticed anything strange in the simulation.No one else had left the battlefield. One instructor explained thatnothing beyond the battlefield ex/sted in that particular segment of thesimulation. No one had missed Kassad. It was as if the incident in theforest - and the woman - had never happened.Kassad knew better. He attended his classes on military history andmathematics. He put in his hours at the firing range and gym. Hewalked off barracks punishments on the Caldera Quadrangle, althoughthese were rare. In general, young Kassad became an even more excellentofficer cadet than he had been. But all the while he waited.And then she came again.Again it was in the final hours of an OCS:HTN simulation.By then Kassad had learned that the exercises were something more thanmere simulations. The OCS:HTN was part of the Worldweb All Thing, thereal-time network which governed Hegemony politics, fed information totens of billions of data-hungry citizens, and had evolved a form ofautonomy and consciousness all its own. More than a hundred and fiftyplanetary data-spheres mingled their resources within the frameworkcreated by six thousand omega-class Als to allow the OCS:HTN tofunction.'The HTN stuff doesn't simulate,' whined Cadet Radinski, the best AIexPert Kassad could find and bribe to explain, 'it dreams, dreams withthe best historical accuracy in the Web - way beyond the sum of itsparts 'cause it plugs in holistic insight as well as facts - and when itdreams, it lets us dream with it."Kassad had not understood but he had believed. And then she came again.In the First US-Vietnam War they made love in the aftermath of an ambushduring the darkness and terror of a night patrol. Kassad wore roughcamouflageclothes- with no underwear because of the jungle crotch rot - and asteel helmet not much more advanced than those at Agincourt. She woreblack pajamas and sandals, the universal garb of the Southeast Asianpeasant.And the Viet Cong. Then neither of them wore anything as they made lovestanding in the night, her back against a tree and her legs wrappedaround him, while beyond them the world exploded in the green glow ofperimeter flares and the sputter-crack of claymores.She came to him on the second day of Gettysburg and again at Borodino,where the clouds of powder smoke hung above the piles of bodies like avapor congealed from departing souls.They made love in the shattered hulk of an APC in Hellas Basin while thehovertank battle still raged and the red dust of the approaching simoonscraped and shrieked at the titanium hull. 'Tell me your name,' he hadwhispered in Standard. She shook her head. 'Are you real- outside thesimulation?" he asked in the Japanese-English of that era. She hadnodded and leaned closer to kiss him.They lay together in a sheltered place among the ruins of Brasilia whiledeathbeams from Chinese EMVs played like blue searchlights on brokenceramic walls.During an unnamed battle after a siege of a forgotten tower city on theRussian steppes, he pulled her back into the shattered room where theyhad made love, and he whiSpered, 'I want to stay with you." She touchedhis lips with a finger and shook her head. After the evacuation of NewChicago, as they lay on the hundredth-floor balcony where Kassad had sethis sniper's nest for the last US President's hopeless rear-guardaction, he placed his hand on the warm flesh between her breasts andsaid, 'Can you ever join me... out there?" She touched his cheek withher palm and smiled.During the last year in Command School there were only five OCS:HTN simsas the cadets' training shifted to live field exercises. Sometimes, aswhen Kitssad was strapped into the tactical command chair during abattalion-sized drop onto Ceres, he closed his eyes, looked between theprimary-colored geographies of thecortically generated tactical/terrain matrix, and felt a sense of...someone? Of her? He was not sure.And then she did not come again. Not in the final months of work. Notin the final simulation of the great Coal Sack Battle where GeneralHorace Glennon-Height's mutiny was defeated. Not during the parades andparties of graduation, nor as the class marched in a final Olympianreview before the Hegemony CEO, saluting from his red-lit levitationdeck.And there was no time even for dreaming as the young officers farcast toEarth's Moon for the Masada Ceremony, farcast again to Tau Ceti Centerfor their formal swearing-in to FORCE, and then they were finished.Second Lieutenant Cadet Kassad became Lieutenant Kassad, spent threestandard weeks free in the Web with a FORCE-issued universal card whichallow him to farcast as far and as frequently as he wished, and then hewas shipped out to the Hegemony Colonial Service training school onLusus to prepare for active duty beyond the Web. He was sure that hewould never see her again.He was wrong.Fedmahn Kassad had grown up in a culture of poverty and sudden death. Asa member of the minority who still called themselves Palestinians, heand his family had lived in the slums of Tharsis, human testimony to thebitter legacy of the terminally dispossessed. Every Palestinian in theWorldweb and beyond carried the cul-turai memory of a century ofstruggle capped by a month of nationalist triumph before the NuclearJihad of 2038 wiped it all away. Then came their second Diaspora, thisone lasting five centuries and leading to dead-end desert worlds likeMars, their dream buried with the death of Old Earth.Kassad, like the .other boys of the South Tharsis Relocation Camps,either ran with gangs or faced the option of being prey to everyself-proclaimed predator in the camps. He chose to run with the gangs.Kassad had killed another youth by the time he was sixteen standardyears old.If Mars was known for anything in the Worldweb, itwas for hunting in the Mariner Valley, Schrauder's Zen Massif in HellasBasin, and the Olympus Command School. Kassad did not have to travel toMariner Valley to learn about hunting and being hunted, he had nointerest in Zen Gnosticism, and as a teenager he felt nothing butcontempt for the uniformed cadets who came from every part of the Web totrain for FORCE.He joined with his peers in sneering at the New Bushido as a code forfaggots, but an ancient vein of honor in the young Kassad's soulsecretly resonated to the thought of a samurai class whose life and workrevolved around duty, self-respect, and the ultimate value of one'sword.When Kassad was eighteen, a Tharsis Province higher circuit judgeoffered him the choice of a Martian year at polar work camp orvolunteering for the John Carter Brigade then forming to help FORCE putdown the resurgent Glennon-Height Rebellion in the Class Three colonies.Kassad volunteered and discovered that he enjoyed the discipline andcleanliness of military life, even though the John Carter Brigade sawonly garrison duty within the Web and was dissolved shortly afterG!ennon-Height's cloned grandson died on Renaissance.Two days after his nineteenth birthday, Kassad applied to FORCE:groundand was turned down. He went on a nine-day drunk, awoke in one of the deeper hive tunnels ofLusus with his military cornlog implant stolen - by someone whoapparently had taken a correspondence course in surgery-his universalcard and farcaster access revoked, and his head exploring new frontiersof pain.Kassad worked on Lusus for a standard year, saving over six thousandmarks and allowing physical labor in the 1.3-ES gravity to put an end tohis Martian frailness.By the time he used his savings to ship out to Maul-Covenant on anancient solar sail freighter with jury-rigged Hawking drives, Kassad wasstill lean and tall by Web standards, but what muscles there were workedwonderfully well by anyone's standards.He arrived on Mani-Covenant three days before the vicious and unpopularIsland War began there, and eventually the FORCE: combined commander atFirstsitegot so tired of seeing the young Kassad waiting in his outer office thathe allowed the boy to enlist in the 23rd Supply Regiment as an assistanthydrofoil driver. Eleven standard months later, Corporal Fedmahn Kassadof the Twelfth Mobile Infantry Battalion had received two DistinguishedService Clusters, a Senate Commendation for valor in the EquatorialArchipelago campaign, and two Purple Hearts. He was also tapped forFORCE command school and shipped Webward on the next convoy.Kassad dreamed of her often. He had never learned her name, she hadnever spoken, but he could have recognized her touch and scent in totaldarkness among a thousand others. He thought of her as Mystery.When other young officers went whoring or seeking girlfriends in theindigenie populations, Kassad would remain on base or take long walksthrough strange cities.He kept his obsession with Mystery secret, knowing full well how itwould read on a psych report. Sometimes, on bivouac under multiplemoons or in the womblike zero-g of a troop transport hold, Kassad wouldrealize how insane his love affair with a phantom truly was. But thenhe would recall the small mole under her left breast which he had kissedone night, feeling her heartbeat under his lips as the ground itselfshook from the firing of the big guns near Verdun. He would rememberthe impatient gesture with which she brushed back her hair as her cheekrested on his thigh. And the young officers would go to town or to thehuts near the base, and Fedmahn Kassad would read another history bookor jog along the perimeter or run tactical strategies on his comiog.It was not long before Kassad came to the attention of his superiors.During the undeclared war with the Free Miners in the Lambert RingTerritories, it was Lieutenant Kassad who led the surviving infantrytroops and Marine guards in cutting through the bottom of the oldasteroid bore shaft on Peregrine to evacuate the Hegemony consulatestaff and citizens.But it was during the short reign of the New Propheton Qom-Riyadh that Captain Fedmahn Kassad came to the attention of theentire Web.The FORCE:space captain of the only Hegemony ship within two leap yearsof the colony world had been paying a courtesy call when the New Prophetchose to lead thirty million New Order Shi'ites against two continentsof Suni shopkeepers and ninety thousand resident Hegemony infidels. Theship's captain and five of his executive officers were taken prisoner.Urgent fatline messages from Tau Ceti Center demanded that the rankingofficer aboard the orbiting HS Denieve settle the situation onQom-Riyadh, free all hostages, and depose the New Prophet . . .without resorting to the use of nuclear weapons within the planet'satmosphere. The Denieve was an aging orbital defense picket. Itcarried no nuclear weapons that could be used within an atmosphere.The ranking officer on board was FORCE:combined Captain Fedmahn Kassad.On the third day of the revolution, Kassad landed the Denieve's singleassault boat in the main courtyard of the Grand Mosque at Mashhad. Heand the other thirty-four FORCE troopers watched as the mob grew tothree hundred thousand militants kept at bay only by the boat'scontainment field and the lack of an order to attack by the New Prophet.The New Prophet himself was no longer in the Grand Mosque; he had flownto the northern hemisphere of Riyadh to join in the victory celebrationsthere.Two hours after he landed, Captain Kassad stepped out of his ship andbroadcast a short announcement. He said that he had been raised as aMuslim. He also announced that interpretation of the Koran since theShi'ites' seedship days had definitely shown that the God of Islam wouldneither condone nor allow the slaughter of the innocent, no matter howmany jihads were proclaimed by tinhorn heretics like the New Prophet.Captain Kassad gave the leaders of the thirty million zealots threehours to surrender their hostages and return to their homes on thedesert continent of Qom.In the first three days of the revolution the armies of the New Prophethad occupied most of the cities on twocontinents and had taken more than twenty-seven thousand Hegemonyhostages. Firing squads had been busy day and night settling ancienttheological disputes and it was estimated that at least a quarter of amillion Sunis had been slaughtered in the first two days of the NewProphet's occupation. In response to Kassad's ultimatum, the NewProphet announced that all of the infidels would be put to deathimmediately following his live television address fhat evening. He alsoordered an attack on Kassad's assault boat.Avoiding high explosives because of the Grand Mosque, the RevolutionaryGuard used automatic weapons, crude energy cannon, plasma charges, andhuman wave attacks. The containment field held.The New Prophet's televised address began fifteen minutes beforeKassad's ultimatum ran out. The New Prophet agreed with Kassad'sstatement that Allah would horribly punish heretics but announced thatit was the Hegemony infidels who would be so punished. It was the onlytime the New Prophet ever had been seen to lose his temper on camera.Screaming, saliva flying, he ordered the human wave attacks to berenewed on the grounded assault boat. He announced that at that momenta dozen fission bombs were being assembled at the occupied Power forPeace reactor in All. With these, the forces of Allah would be carriedinto space itself. The first fission bomb, he explained, would be usedon the infidel Kassad's satanic assault boat that very afternoon.The New Prophet then began to explain exactly how the Hegemony hostageswould be executed, but at that moment Kassad's deadline ran out.Qom-Riyadh was, by its own choice and the accident of its distantlocation, a technically primitive world. But the inhabitants were notso primitive that they did not have an active datasphere. Nor were therevolutionary mullahs who had led the invasion so opposed to the 'GreatSatan of Hegemony Science' that they refused to tie into the global datanet with their personal cornlogs.The HS Denieve had seeded enough spysats so that by 1729 hoursQom-Riyadh Central Time, the datasphere had been tapped to the pointthat the Hegemony ship hadidentified sixteen thousand eight hundred and thirty revolutionarymuilahs by their access codes. At 1729:30 hours the spysats beganfeeding their real-time targeting data to the twenty-one perimeterdefense sats which Kassad's assault boat had left in low orbit. Theseorbital defense weapons were so old that the Denieve's mission had beento return them to the Web for safe destruction.Kassad had suggested another use for them.At precisely 1730 hours, nineteen of the small satellites detonatedtheir fusion cores. In the nanoseconds before their self-destruction,the resulting X rays were focused, aimed, and released in sixteenthousand eight hundred and thirty invisible but very coherent beams. Theancient defense sats were not designed for atmospheric use and had aneffective destructive radius of less than a millimeter.Luckily, that was all that was needed. Not all of the targeting beamspenetrated whatever stood between the mu!lahs and the sky. Fifteenthousand seven hundred and eighty-four did.The effect was immediate and dramatic. In each case the target's brainand cerebral fluid boiled, turned to vapor, and blew the encasing skullto bits. The New Prophet was in the middle of his live, planetwidebroadcast - literally in the middle of pronouncing the word 'heretic' -when 1730 hours arrived.For almost two minutes the TV screens and walls around the planetcarried the image of the New Prophet's headless body slumped over themicrophone. Then Fedmahn Kassad cut in on all bands to announce thathis next deadline was one hour away and that any actions against thehostages would be met with a more dramaticdemonstration of Allah's displeasure.There were no reprisals.That night, in orbit around Q0m-Riyadh, Mystery visited Kassad for thefirst time since his cadet days. He was asleep but the visit was morethan a dream and less than the alternative reality of the OCS:HTN sims.The woman and he were lying together under a light blanket beneath abroken roof. Her skin was warm and electric, her face little more thana pale outline against nighttime darkness. Overhead the stars had justbegun to fade intothe false light of predawn. Kassad realized that she was trying tospeak to him; her soft lips formed words which were just below thethreshold of Kassad's hearing. He pulled back a second in order to seeher face better and, in so doing, lost contact completely. He awoke inhis sleep webbing with moisture on his cheeks and the hum of the ship'ssystems sounding as strange to him as the breathing of somehalf-awakened beast.Nine standard ship weeks later, Kassad stood before a FORCEcourt-martial review on Freeholm. He had known when he made hisdecision on Qom-Riyadh that his superiors would have no choice but tocrucify or promote him.FORCE prided itself on preparing itself for all contingencies in the Webor the colonial regions, but nothing had properly prepared it for theBattle of South Bressia and its implications for the New Bushido.The New Bushido Code which governed Colonel Kassad's life had evolvedout of the necessity for the military class to survive. After theobscenities of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries onOld Earth, when military leaders had committed their nations tostrategies wherein entire civilian populations were legitimate targetswhile their uniformed executioners sat safe in self-contained bunkersfifty meters under the earth, the repugnance of the surviving civilianswas so great that for more than a century the word 'military' was aninvitation to a lynching.As the New Bushido evolved it combined the age-old concepts of honor andindividual courage with the need to spare civilians whenever possible.It also saw the wisdom of returning to the pre-Napoleonic concepts ofsmall, 'nontotal' wars with defined goals and proscribed excesses. TheCode demanded a forsaking of nuclear weapons and strategic bombingcampaigns in all but the most extreme cases but, more than that, itdemanded a return to Old Earth medieval concepts of set battles betweensmall, professional forces at a mutually agreed upon time in a placewhere destruction of public and private property would be kept to aminimum.This Code worked well for the first four centuries of post-Hegiraexpansion. The fact that essential technologies were essentially frozenin place for three of those centuries worked in the Hegemony's favor asits monopoly on the use of farcasters allowed it to apply the modestresources of FORCE at the right place in the required amount of time.Even when separated by the inevitable leap years of time-debt, nocolonial or independent world could hope to match the power of theHegemony. Incidents .such as the political rebellion on Maui-Covenant,with its unique guerrilla warfare, or the religious insanity onQom-Riyadh were put down quickly and firmly and any excesses in thecampaigns merely pointed out the importance of returning to the strictCode of the New Bushido. But for all of FORCE's calculations andpreparations, no one had adequately planned on the inevitableconfrontation with the Ousters.The Ousters had been the single external threat to the Hegemony for thefour centuries since the forebears of the barbarian hordes had left SolSystem in their crude fleet of leaking O'Neill cities, tumblingasteroids, and experimental comet farm clusters. Even after the Oustersacquired the Hawking drive, it remained official Hegemony policy toignore them as long as their swarms stayed in the darkness between thestars and limited their in-system plunderings to scooping small amountsof hydrogen from gas giants and water ice from uninhabited moons.The early Outback skirmishes such as Bent's World and GHC 2990 wereconsidered aberrations, of little interest to the Hegemony. Even thepitched battle for Lee Three had been treated as a Colonial Serviceproblem and when the FORCE task force arrived six local years after theattack, five years after the Ousters departed, any atrocities wereconveniently forgotten in favor of the view that no barbarian raid wouldrepeat itself when the Hegemony chose to flex its muscle.In the decades which followed Lee Three, FORCE and Ouster space'forcesskirmished in a hundred borderareas, but except for the odd Marine encounters in airless, weightlessplaces, there were no infantry confrontations.Stories in the Worldweb proliferated: the Ousters would never be athreat to Earthlike worlds because of their three centuries ofadaptation to weight-lessness; the Ousters had evolved into somethingmore -or less - than human; the Ousters did not have farcastertechnology, would never have it, and thus never would.be a threat to FORCE. Then came Bressia.Bressia was one of those smug, independent worlds, pleased with both itsconvenient access to the Web and its eight-month separation from it,growing rich from the export of diamonds, burr root, and its unequaledcoffee, coyly refusing to become a colony world but still dependent uponthe Hegemony Protectorate and Common Market to meet its soaring economicgoals. As with most such worlds, Bressia was proud of its Self-defenseForce: twelve torchships, a refitted attack carrier which had beendecommissioned by FORCE:space half a century earlier, twoscore or moreof small, fast orbital patrol vessels, a standing army of ninetythousand volunteers, a respectable oceangoing navy, and a store ofnuclear weapons stockpiled purely for symbolic purposes.The Ouster Hawking wake had been noticed by Hegemony monitoring stationsbut was misinterpreted as merely another swarm migration which wouldpass no closer than half a light-year to the Bressian system.Instead, with a single course correction which was not detected untilthe swarm was within the O6rt cloud radius, the Ousters fell on Bressialike some Old Testament plague. A minimum of seven standard monthsseparated Bressia from any Hegemony rescue or response.Bressia's space force was obliterated within the first twenty hours offighting. The Ouster swarm then put more than three thousand ships intoBressia's cislunar space and began the systematic reduction of allplanetary defenses.The world had been settled by no-nonsense Central Europeans in the firstwave of the Hegira, and its two continents bore the prosaic names ofNorth Bressia andSouth Bressia. North Bressia held desert, high tundra, and six majorcities housing mostly burr-root harvesters and petroleum engineers.South Bressia, much more temperate in climate and geography, was thehome for most of the world's four hundred million people and the hugecoffee plantations.As if to demonstrate what war had once been about, the Ousters scouredNorth Bressia - first with several hundred fallout-free nuclear weaponsand tactical plasma bombs, then with deathbeams, and finally withtailored viruses. Only a handful of the fourteen million residentsescaped. South Bressia received no bombardment except for the lancingof specific military targets, airports, and the large harbor at Solno.FORCE doctrine held that, while a world could be reduced from orbit,actual military invasion of an industrialized planet was animpossibility; the problems with landing logistics, the immense area tobe occupied, and the unwieldy size of the invading army were consideredto be the ultimate arguments against invasion.The Ousters obviously had not read the FORCE doctrine books. On thetwenty-third day of the investiture, more than two thousand dropshipsand assault boats fell on South Bressia. What was left of the Bressianair force was destroyed in those first hours of the invasion. Twonuclear' devices were actually detonated against Ouster staging areas:the first was deflected by energy fields and the second destroyed asingle scoutship which may have been a decoy.Ousters, it turned out, had changed physically in three centuries. Theydid prefer zero-gravity environments.But their mobile infantry's powered exoskeletons served very well and itwas only, a matter of days before the black-clad, 1ong-limbed Oustertroops were swarming over South Bressia's cities like an infestation ofgiant spiders.The last organized resistance collapsed on the nineteenth day of theinvasion. Buckminster, the capital, fell the same day. The lastfatline message from Bressia to the Hegemony was cut off inmid-transmission an hour after Ouster troops entered the city.Colonel Fedmahn Kassad arrived with FORCE Fleet One twenty-nine standardweeks later. Thirty omega-class torchships protecting a single,farcaster-equipped JumpShip penetrated the system at high speed. Thesingularity sphere was activated three hours after spin-down and tenhours after that there were four hundred FORCE ships of the line insystem. The counterinvasion began twenty-one hours later.Those were the mathematics of the first minutes of the Battle ofBressia. For Kassad, the memory of those days and weeks held notmathematics but the terrible beauty of combat. It was the first timeJumpShips had been used on anything above a division level and there wasthe expected confusion. Kassad went through from five light-minutes outand fell into gravel and yellow dust because. the assault boatfarcaster portal was facing down a steep incline made slick with mud andthe blood of the first squads through. Kassad lay in the mud and lookeddown the hillside at madness. Ten of the seventeen farcaster assaultboats were down and burning, scattered across the foothills andplantation fields like broken toys. The containment fields of thesurviving boats were shrinking under an onslaught of missile and CPBfire that turned the landing areas into domes of orange flame. Kassad'stactical display was a hopeless mess; his visor showed a garble ofimpossible fire vectors, blinking red phosphors where FORCE troops laydying, and overlays of Ouster jamming ghosts. Someone was screaming'Oh, goddammit! Goddammit! Oh, goddammit!" on his primary commandcircuit and the implants registered a void where Command Group's datashould be.An enlisted man helped him up, Kassad flicked mud off his command wandand got out of the way of the next squad farcasting through, and the warwas on.From his first minutes on South Bressia, Kassad realized that the NewBushido was dead. Eighty thousand superbly armed and trainedFORCE:ground troops advanced from their staging areas, seeking battle inan unpopulated place. Ouster forces retreated behind a lineof scorched earth, leaving only booby traps and dead civilians. FORCEused farcasters to outmaneuver the enemy, to force him to fight. TheOusters responded with a barrage of nuclear and plasma weapons, pinningthe ground troops under forcefields while the Ouster infantry retreatedto prepared 'defenses around cities and dropship staging areas.There were no quick victories in space to shift the balance on SouthBressia. Despite feints and occasional fierce battles, the Oustersretained complete control of everything within three AU of Bressia.FORCE:space units fell back and concentrated on keeping the fleet withinfarcaster range and protecting the primary JumpShip.What had been. forecast as a two-day battle ground on for thirty days,then sixty. Warfare had been thrown back to the twentieth ortwenty-first century: long, grim campaigns fought through the brick dustof ruined cities over the corpses of civilians. The eighty thousandoriginal FORCE troops were ground up, reinforced with a hundred thousandmore, and were still being decimated when the call went out for twohundred thousand more.Only the grim resolve of Meina Gladstone and a dozen other determinedsenators kept the war alive and the troops dying while the billions ofvoices of the All Thing and the AI Advisory Council called fordisengagement.Kassad had understood the change of tactics almost at once. Hisstreet-fighting instincts had risen to the forefront even before most ofhis division was wiped out in the Battle of the Stoneheap. While otherFORCE commanders were all but ceasing to function, frozen intoindecision by this violation of the New Bushido, Kassad - in command ofhis regiment and in temporary command of his division after the nukingof Command Group Delta - was trading men for time and calling for therelease of fusion weapons to spearhead his own counterattack. By thetime the Ousters withdrew ninety-seven days after the FORCE 'rescue' ofBressia, Kassad had earned the double-edged nickname of the Butcher ofSouth Bressia. It was rumored that even his own troops were afraid ofhim.And Kassad dreamed of her with dreams that were more - and less - thandreams.On the last night of the Battle for Stoneheap, in the maze of darktunnels where Kassad and his hunter-killer groups used sonics and T-5gas to flush out the last warrens of Ouster commandos, the Colonel fellasleep amid the flame and screams and felt the touch of her long fingerson his cheek and the soft compression of her breasts against him.When they entered New Vienna on the morning after the space strikeKassad had called in, the troops following the glass-smooth,twenty-meter-wide burn grooves into the lanced city, Kassad had staredwithout blinking at the rows of human heads lying on the pavement,carefully lined up as if to welcome the rescuing FORCE troops with theiraccusatory stares. Kassad had returned to his command EMV, closed thehatches, and - curling up in the warm darkness smelling of rubber,heated plastics, charged ions - had heard her whispers over the babbleof the C3 channels and implant coding.On the night before the Ouster retreat, Kassad left the commandconference on the HS Brazil, farcast to his HQ in the Indelibles northof the Hyne Valley, and took his command car to the summit to watch thefinal bombardment.The nearest of the tactical nuclear strikes was forty-five kilometersaway. The plasma bombs blossomed like orange and blood-red flowersplanted in a perfect grid.Kassad counted more than two hundred dancing columns of green light asthe hellwhip lances ripped the broad plateau to shreds. And even beforehe slept, while he sat on the flare skirt of the EMV and shook paleafterimages from his eyes, she came. She wore a pale blue dress andwalked lightly between the dead burr-root plants on the hillside.The breeze lifted the hem of the soft fabric of her dress. Her face andarms were pale, almost translucent. She called his name -hecouldalmosthearthewords - andthenthesec-ond wave of bombardment rolledin across the plain below him and everything was lost in noise andflame.As tends to be the case in a universe apparently ruled by irony, FedmahnKassad passed unscathed through ninety seven days of the worst fightingthe Hegemony had everseen, only to be wounded two days after the last of the Ousters hadretreated to their fleeing swarmships. He was in the Civic CenterBuilding in Buckminster, one of only three buildings left standing inthe city, giving curt answers to stupid questions from a Worldwebnewsteep when a plasma booby trap no larger than a microswitch explodedfifteen floors above, blew the newsteep and two of Kassad's aidesthrough a ventilator grille into the street beyond, and dropped thebuilding on him.Kassad was medevacked to division HQ and then far-cast to the JumpShipnow in orbit around Bressia's second moon. There he was resuscitatedand put on full life support while the military brass and Hegemonypoliticians decided what to do with him.Because of the farcaster connection and the real-time media coverage ofBressia, Colonel Fedmahn Kassad had become somewhat of a cause cdibre.Those billions who had been appalled by the unprecedented savagery ofthe South Bressia campaign would have been pleased to see Kassadcourt-martialed or tried for war crimes. CEO Gladstone and many othersconsidered Kassad and the other FORCE commanders as saviors.In the end, Kassad was put on a hospital spinship for the slow trip backto the Web. Since most of the physical repair would be done in fugueanyway, it made some sense to let the old hospital ships work on theseriously wounded and the revivable dead. By the time Kassad and' the other patients reached the Worldweb, they would be ready foractive duty. More importantly, Kassad would have accrued a time-debt ofat least eighteen standard months and whatever controversy surroundedhim might well be over by that time.Kassad awoke to see the dark shape of a woman bending over him. For asecond he was sure that it was her, andthen he realized that it was aFORCE medic.'Am I dead?" he whispered.'You were. You're on the HS Merrick. You've been through resuscitationand renewal several times but you probably don't. remember because ofthe fugue hangover.We're ready to start the next step in physicaltherapy. Do you feel like trying to walk?"Kassad lifted his arm to cover his eyes. Even through thedisorientation of fugue state, he now remembered the painful therapysessions, the long hours in the RNA virus baths, and the surgery. Mostof all the surgery.'What's our route?" he asked, still shielding his eyes. 'I forget howwe're getting back to the Web."The medic smiled as if this were a question he asked each time he cameout of fugue. Perhaps it was. 'We'll be putting in at Hyperion andGarden,' she said. 'We're just entering the orbit of..."The woman was interrupted by the sound of the end of the world - greatbrass trumpets blowing, metal ripping, furies screaming. Kassad rolledoff the bed, wrapping the mattress around him as he fell in theone-sixth g.Hurricane winds slid him across the deck and hurled pitchers, trays,bedclothes, books, bodies, metal instruments, and countless otherobjects at him. Men and women were screaming, their voices risingthrough falsetto as the air rushed out of the ward. Kassad felt themattress slam into the wall; he looked out between clenched fists.A meter from him, a football-sized spider with wildly waving legs wastrying to force itself into a crack which had suddenly appeared in thebulkhead. The thing's jointless legs seemed to be swatting at the paperand other detritus whirling around it. The spider rotated and Kassadrealized that it was the head of the medic; she had been decapitated inthe initial explosion. Her long hair writhed at Kassad's face. Thenthe crack widened to the width of a fist and the head disappearedthrough it.Kassad pulled himself up just as the boom arm quit spinning and 'up'ceased to be. The only forces now in play were the hurricane windsstill flinging everything in the ward toward the cracks and gaps in thebulkhead and the sickening lurch and tumble of the ship. Kassad swamagainst it all, pulling himself toward the door to the boom-armcorridor, using every handhold he could find, kicking free the last fivemeters. A metal tray struck him above the eye; a corpse withhemorrhaged eyes almost tumbled him back into the ward. The airtightemergencydoors were slamming uselessly into a dead Marine whose spacesuited bodyblocked the seal from closing. Kassad rolled through into the boom-armshaft and pulled the corpse after him. The door sealed behind him, butthere was no more air in the shaft than there had been in the ward.Somewhere a klaxon's scream thinned to inaudibility.Kassad also screamed, trying to relieve the pressure so that his lungsand eardrums would not burst. The boom arm was still draining air; heand the corpse were being sucked the hundred and thirty meters to themain body of the ship. He and the dead Marine tumbled along theboom-arm shaft in a grisly waltz.It took Kassad twenty seconds to slap open the emergency releases on theMarine's suit, another minute to eject the man's corpse and to get hisown body in. He was at least ten centimeters taller than the dead man,and although the suit was built to allow some expansion, it stillpinched painfully at his neck and wrists and knees.The helmet squeezed his forehead like a cushioned vise.Gobbets of blood and a moist white material clung to tbe inside of thevisor. The piece of shrapnel which had killed the Marine had leftentrance and exit holes, but tbe suit had done its best to seal itself.Most of the chest lights were red and the suit did not respond whenKassad ordered it to give a status report, but the rebreather worked,although with a worrying rasp.Kassad tried the suit radio. Nothing, not even background static. Hefound the comlog lead, jacked into a hull termex. Nothing. The shippitched again then, metal reverberating to a succession of blows, andKassad was thrown against the wall of the boom-arm shaft. One of thetransport cages tumbled by, its severed cables whipping like thetentacles of an agitated sea anemone. There were corpses in the cageand more bodies tangled along the segments of spiral staircase stillintac along the shaft wall. Kassad kicked the remaining distance to theend of the shaft and found all of the airtight doors there sealed, theboom-arm shaft itself irised shut, but there were holes in the primarybulkhead large enough to drive a commercial EMV through.The ship lurched again and began to tumble more wildly, impartingcomplex new Coriolis forces to Kassad and everything else in the shaft.Kassad hung on torn metal and pulled himself through a rent in thetriple hull of the HS Merrick.He almost laughed when he saw the interior. Whoever had lanced the oldhospital ship had done it right, chopping and stabbing the hull withCPBs until pressure seals failed, self-seal units ruptured,damage-control remotes overloaded, and the interior bulkheads collapsed.Then the enemy ship had put missiles into the guts of the hulk withwarheads o f what the FORCE:space people quaintly called canister shot.The effect had been quite similar to setting off an antipersonnelgrenade in a crowded rat maze.Lights shone through a thousand holes, here and there becoming colorfulrays where they found a colloidal base in floating haze of dust or bloodor lubricant. From where Kassad hung, twisting with the lurch andtumble of the ship, he could see a score or more of bodies, naked andtorn, each moving with the deceptive underwater-ballet grace of thezero-gravity dead. Most of the corpses floated within their own smallsolar systems of blood and tissue. Several of them watched Kassad withthe cartoon-character sares of their pressure-expanded eyes and seemedto beckon him closer with random, languid movements of arms and hands.Kassad kicked through the wreckage to reach the main dropshaft to thecommand core. He had seen no weapons - it seemed that no one except theMarine had managed to suit up - but he knew that there would be aweapons locker in the command core or in the Marine quarters aft.Kassad stopped at the last torn pressure seal and stared. He did laughthis time. Beyond this point there was no main dropshaft, no aftsection. There was no ship. This section - a boom-arm and medical wardmod, a ragged chunk of the hull - had been ripped free of the ship aseasily as Beowulf had torn the arm from Grendel's body. The final,unsealed doorway to the dropshaft led to open space. Some kilometersaway,Kassad could see a dozen other ravaged fragments of the HS Merricktumbling in the glare of sunlight. A green and lapis planet loomed soclose that Kassad felt a surge of acrophobia and clung more tightly tothe doorframe.Even as he watched, a star moved above the limb of the planet, laserweapons winked their ruby morse, and a gutted ship section half akilometer away across the gulf of vacuum from Kassad burst again in agout of vaporized metal, freezing volatiles, and tumbling black speckswhich Kassad realized were bodies.Kassad pulled himself deeper into the concealing tangle of wreckage andconsidered his situation. The Marine's suit could not last more thananother hour -already Kassad could smell the rotten-eggs stench of themalfunctioning rebreather - and he had seen no airtight compartment orcontainer during his struggle through the wreckage. And even if hefound a closet or air-lock to shelter in, what then? Kassad did notknow if the planet below was Hyperion or Garden, but he was sure thatthere was no FORCE presence on either world. He was also quite surethat no local defense forces would challenge an Ouster warship. Itwould be days before any patrol craft investigated the wreckage. It wasquite possible, Kassad knew, that the orbit of the tumbling piece ofjunk he now inhabited would decay before they sent anyone up to check onit, sending thousands of tons of twisted metal burning through theatmosphere.The locals would not like that, Kassad knew, but from their point ofview it might be preferable to let a bit of sky fall than to antagonizethe Ousters. If the planet had primitive orbital defenses orground-based CPBs, he realized with a grim smile, it would make moresense for them to blast the wreckage than to fire on the Ouster ship.It would make no difference to Kassad. Unless he did something quickly,he would be dead long before the remnants of the ship entered atmosphereor the locals took action.The Marine's amplification shield had been cracked by the shrapnel whichhad killed him, but now Kassad tugged what was left of the viewplatedown over thevisor. Telltales winked red but there was still enough suit power toshow the amplified view glowing pale green through the spiderweb ofcracks. Kassad watched as the Ouster torchship stood off a hundredklicks, its defense fields blurring background stars, and launchedseveral objects. For an instant Kassad was sure that these were thecoup de grdce missiles and he found himself grinning joylessly at thecertainty of having only a few seconds to live. Then he noticed theirlow velocity and notched the amplification higher. The power lightsblinked red and the amplifier failed, but not before Kassad had seen thetapering ovoid shapes, spotted with thrusters and cockpit blisters, eachtrailing a tangle of six jointless manipulator arms. 'Squids,' theFORCE:space people had called the Ouster boarding craft.Kassad pulled himself farther back in the wreckage.He had only a few minutes before one or more of the squids reached hispiece of the ship. How many Ousters would one of those things carry?Ten? Twenty? Kassad was sure that it would be no fewer than ten. Andthey would be well armed and rigged with infrared and motion sensors.The elite Ouster equivalent of Hegemony Space Marines, the commandoswould not only have been trained for free-fall combat but had been bornand bred to zero-g. Their long limbs, prehensile toes, and prosthetictails would be added advantages for this environment, although Kassaddoubted that they needed any more advantages than they already had.He began to pull himself carefully back through the labyrinth of twistedmetal, fighting the adrenaline fear-surge that made him want to kick offscreaming through the darkness. What did they want? Prisoners. Thatwould solve his immediate survival problem. All he had to do to survivewas surrender. The difficulty with that solution' was that Kassad hadseen the FORCE:intelligence holos of the Ouster ship they had capturedoff Bressia. There had been more than two hundred prisoners in thestorage bay of that ship. And the Ousters obviously had many questionsfor these Hegemony citizens.Perhaps they had found it inconvenient to feed and imprison so many- orperhaps it was their basicinterrogation policy - but the fact was that the Bressian civilians andcaptured FORCE troops had been found flayed open and pinned down onsteel trays like frogs in a biology lab, their organs bathed withnutrient fluids, arms and legs efficiently amputated, eyes removed, andtheir minds readied for interrogators' questions with crude corticalcomtaps and shunt-plugs jacked directly through three-centimeter holesin the skulls.Kassad pulled himself along, floating through debris and the tangledentrails of the ship's wiring. He felt no inclination whatsoever tosurrender. The tumbling hulk vibrated and then steadied some as atleast one of the squids attached itself to the hull or bulkhead. Think,Kassad commanded. He needed a weapon more than a hiding place. Had heseen anything during his crawl through the wreckage that would help himsurvive?Kassad stopped moving and hung from an exposed section of fiberopticcable while he thought. The medical ward where he had awakened, beds,fugue tanks, intensive care apparatus... most of it expelled throughthe breaches in the spinmod's hull. Boom-arm shaft, elevator cage,corpses on the stairs. No weapons. Most of the bodies had beenstripped by the canister shot explosions or sudden decompression. Theelevator cables? No, too long, impossible to sever without tools.Tools? He had seen none. The medical offices fiayed open along thecorridors beyond the main dropshaft. Medical imaging rooms, MRI tanks,and CPD bays flung open like looted sarcophagi. At least one operatingroom intact, its interior a maze of scattered instruments and floatingcables.The solarium, scraped clean when the windows exploded outward. Patientlounges. Medics' lounges. The scrub rooms, corridors, andunidentifiable cubicles. The corpses.Kassad hung there a second longer, oriented himself in tbe tumbling mazeof light and shadow, and then kicked off.He had hoped for ten minutes; he was given less than eight. He knewthat the Ousters would be methodical and efficient but hadunderestimated how efficient they could be in zero-g. He gambled hislife that there wouldbe at least two of them on each sweep - basic Space Marine procedure,much as FORCE:ground jump rats had learned to go door to door il cityfighting, one to burst into each room, the other to provide cover fire.If there were more than two, if the Ousters worked in squads of four,Kassad almost certainly would be dead.He was floating in the middle of Operating Room 3 when the Ouster camethrough the door. Kassad's febfeather had all but failed, he wasfloating immobile, gasping foul air, as the Ouster commando swung in,swung aside, and brought his two weapons to bear on the unarmed figurein a battered Marine spacesuit.Kassad had bargained that the gruesome condition of his suit and visorwould gain him a second or two.Behind his gore-smeared faceplate, Kassad's eyes stared sightlesslyupward as the Ouster's chestlight swept across him. The commandocarried two weapons- a sonic stunner in one hand and a smaller but muchmore lethal tightbeam pistol in the long toes of his left 'foot." Heraised the sonic. Kassad had time to notice the killing spike on theprosthetic tail and then he triggered the mouse in his gauntleted righthand.It had taken Kassad most of his eight minutes to tie in the emergencygenerator to the operating-room circuits.Not all of the surgery lasers had survived, but six still worked. Kassadhad positioned four of the smaller ones to cover the area just to theleft of the doorway, the two bone-cutters to target the space to theright. The Ouster had moved to the right.The Ouster's suit exploded. The lasers continued to slice away in theirpreprogrammed circles as Kassad propelled himself forward, ducking underthe blue beams now swirling in a spreading mist of useless suit sealantand boiling blood. He wrested the sonic away just as the second Ousterswung into the room, agile as an Old Earth chimp.Kassad pressed the sonic against the man's helmet and fired. The suitedfigure went !imp. The prosthetic tail spasmed a few times from randomnerve impulses. Triggering the sonic that close was no way to take aprisoner; a burst from that distance turned a human brain intosomething resembling oatmeal mush. Kassad did not want to take aprisoner.He kicked free,. grabbed a girder, swept the active sonic across theopen doorway. No one else came through. A check twenty seconds latershowed an empty corridor.Kassad ignored the first body and stripped the man with the intact suit.The commando was naked under the spacesuit and it turned out not to be aman; the female commando had short-cropped blond hair, small breasts,and a tattoo just above her line of pubic hair. She was very pale anddroplets of blood floated from her nose, ears, and eyes. Kassad made anote that the Ousters used women in their Marines. All of the Ousterbodies on Bressia had been male.He kept his helmet and rebreather pack on as he kicked the body asideand tugged on the unfamiliar suit.Vacuum exploded blood vessels in his flesh. Deep cold nipped at him ashe struggled with strange clasps and locks. Tall as he was, he was tooshort for the woman's suit. He could operate the hand gauntlets bystretching, but the foot gloves and tail connections were hopeless.Hc let them hang useless as he bailed out of his own helmet and wrestledthe Ouster bubble into place.Lights in the collar diskey glowed amber and violet.Kassad heard the rush of air through aching eardrums and almost gaggedas a thick, rich stench assailed him.He assumed it was the sweet smell of home to an Ouster.Earphone patches in the bubble whispered coded commands in a languagewhich sounded like an audio tape of Ancient English played backward athigh speed.Kassad was gambling again, this time on the fact that Ouster groundunits on Bressia had functioned as semi-independent teams united byvoice radio and basic telemetry rather than a FORCE:ground type oftactical implant web. If they used the same system here, then thecommando leader might know that two of his (or her) troops were missing,possibly even have medcom readings on them, but might not know exactlywhere they were.Kassad decided that it was time to quit hypothesizingand to get moving. He programmed the mouse to have the surgical lasersfire on anything entering the operating room, and then bounce-stumbledhis way down the corridor.Moving in one of these damn suits, he thought, was like trying to walkin a gravity field while standing on your own trousers. He had broughtalong both energy pistols and - finding no belt, lockrings, hooks,Velcro pads, macclamps, or pockets to secure them with - now floatedalong like some drunken holodrama pirate, a weapon in each hand,bouncing from wall to wall. Reluc-tanfly, he left one pistol floatingbehind him while he tried to hook himself along one-handed. Thegauntlet fit like a size fifteen mitten on a size two hand. The damnedtail wobbled, banged against his helmet bubble, and was a literal painin the ass.Twice he squeezed into crevices when he saw lights in the distance. Hewas just about to the deck opening where he had watched the squidapproach when he rounded a corner and almost floated into three Oustercommandos.The fact that he was wearing an Ouster suit gave him at least atwo-second advantage. He shot the first suited figure in the helmet atpoint-blank range. The second man- or woman- fired a wild sonic burstpast Kassad's left shoulder a second before he put three bolts into theOuster's chestplate. The third commando flipped backward, found threehandholds, and was out of sight around a broken bulkhead before Kassadcould retarget. His headset rang with curses, commands, and questions.Kassad gave silent chase.The third Ouster would have escaped if he had not rediscovered honor andturned to fight. Kassad felt an inexplicable sense of djt vu as he putan energy bolt through the man's left eye from five meters away.The corpse tumbled backward into sunlight. Kassad pulled himself to theopening and stared at the squid moored not twenty meters'away. It was,he thought, the first undiluted piece of luck he had had in some time.He kicked across the gap, knowing that if someone wanted to shoot himfrom the squid or the wreckage there was nothing he could do about it.He felt thescrotum-lifting tension he always experienced when he was an obvioustarget. No shots were fired. Commands and interrogatives squawked inhis ears. He could not understand them, did not know where theyoriginated, and, on the whole, thought it best if he stayed out of thedialogue.The clumsiness of the suit almost caused him to miss the squid. Hethought briefly that such an anticlimax would be the universe's fittingverdict on his martial pretensions: the brave warrior floating off intonear-planet orbit, no maneuvering systems, no propellant, no reactionmass of any sort - even the pistol was non-recoil.He would end his life as useless and harmless as a child's runawayballoon.Kassad stretched until his joints popped, caught a whip antenna, andpulled himself hand over handto the squid's hull.Where the hell was the airlock? The hull was relatively smooth for aspacefaring vessel but was decorated with a riot of designs, decals, andpanels announcing what he assumed were the Ouster equivalents of NO STEPand DANGER: THRUSTER PORT. No entrances were visible. He guessed thatthere were Ousters on board, a pilot at least, and that they wereprobably wondering why their returning commando was crawling around thehull like a spavined crab rather than cycling the airlock. Or perhapsthey knew why and were waiting inside with drawn pistols.At any rate, it was obvious that no one was going to open the door forhim.The hell with it, thought Kassad and shot out one of 'the observationblisters.The Ousters kept a tidy ship. Not much more than the equivalent of afew lost paper clips and coins geysered out with the ship's air. Kassadwaited until the eruption had died down and squeezed through the gap.He was in the carrier section: a cushioned hold looking a lot like thejump rat bay of any dropship or APC.Kassad made a mental note that a squid probably held about twenty Oustercommandos in full vacuum combat gear. Now it was empty. An open hatchled to the cockpit.Only the command pilot had remained on board and he was in the finalprocess of unbelting when Kassad shot him. Kassad pushed the body intothe carrier section and strapped himself into what he hoped was thecommand chair.Warm sunlight came through the blister above him.Video monitors and console hoios showed scenes from dead ahead, astern,and shoulder-camera glimpses of the search operation inside. Kassadcaught a glimpse of the nude body in Operating Room 3 and severalfigures in a firefight with surgical lasers.In the holodramas of Fedmahn Kassad's childhood, heroes always seemed toknow how to operate skimmers, spacecraft, exotic EMVs, and other strangemachinery whenever the need arose. Kassad had been trained to handlemilitary transports, simple tanks and APCs, even an assault boat ordropship if he was desperate. If stranded on a runaway FORCEspacecraft, a remote possibility, he could find his way around thecommand core sufficiently to communicate with the primary computer orput out a distress call on a radio or fatline transmitter.Sitting in the command chair of an Ouster squid, Kassad did not have aclue.That was not quite true. He immediately recognized the remote gripslots for the squid's tentacle manipulators, and given two or threehours of thought and inspection, he might have figured out several othercontrols. He did not have the time. The forward screen showed threespacesuited figures jumping for the squid, firing as they came. Thepale, oddly alien head of an Ouster commander suddenly materialized onthe holo console. Kassad heard shouts from his bubble earpatches.Globules of sweat hung in front of his eyes and streaked the inside ofhis helmet. He shook them away as best he could, squinted at thecontrol consoles, and pushed several likely-looking surfaces. If therewere voice command circuits, override controls, or a suspicious ship'scomputer, Kassad knew, he was screwed. He had thought of all this inthe second or two before he shot the pilot but had not been able tothink of a way to coerceor trust the man. No, this had to be the way, thoughtKassad even as he tapped more control surfaces.A thruster began firing.The squid pulled and tugged at its moorings. Kassad bounced back andforth in his webbing. 'Shit,' he whispered, his first audible commentsince he had asked the FORCE medic where the ship was putting in. Hestrained far enough forward to get his gauntleted fingers into the gripslots. Four of the six manipulators released. One ripped off. Thefinal one tore away a chunk of bulkhead from the HS Merrick.The squid tumbled free. Video cameras showed two of the space-suitedfigures missing their jumps, the third clutching at the same whipantenna which had saved Kassad. Knowing roughly where the thrustercontrols were'now, Kassad tapped in a frenzy. An overhead light cameon. All of the holo projectors went dead. The squid commenced amaneuver which incorporated all of the most violent elements of pitch,roll, and yaw. Kassad saw the spacesuited form tumble past the overheadblister, appear briefly on the forward video screen, become a speck onthe aft screen. The Ouster was still firing energy bolts as he - or she- became too small to see.Kassad struggled to stay conscious as the violent tumbling continued.Various voice and visual alarms were screaming for his attention. Kassadtapped at thruster controls, considered it a success, and pulled hishands away when he felt as if he were being pulled apart in only twodirections rather than five.A random camera shot showed him that the torchship was receding. Good.Kassad had no doubt that the Ouster warship could destroy him at anysecond, and that it would if he approached or threatened it in any way.He did not know if the squid was armed, personally doubted if it wouldcarry anything larger than antipersonnel weapons, but he knew beyond adoubt that no torchship commander would allow an out-of-controlshuttlecraft to come anywhere near his ship.Kassad assumed that the Ousters all knew by now that the squid had beenhijacked by the enemy. He would not be surprised - disappointed, butnot surprised - if thetorchship vaporized him at any second, but in the meantime he wascounting on two emotions that were quint-essentially human if notnecessarily Ouster human: curiosity and the desire for revenge.Curiosity, he knew, could easily be overridden in times of stress, buthe counted on a paramilitary, semifeudal culture like the Ousters' to bedeeply involved with revenge. Everything else being equal, with nochance to hurt them further and almost no chance to escape, it wouldseem that Colonel Fedmahn Kassad had become a prime candidate for one oftheir dissection trays. He hoped so.Kassad looked at the forward video display, frowned, and loosened hisharness long enough to look out the overhead blister. The ship wastumbling but not nearly so violently as before. The planet seemedcloser - one hemisphere filled the view 'above' him - but he had no ideahow close the squid Was to atmosphere. He could read none of the datadisplays. He could only guess what their orbital velocity had been andhow violent a reentry shock would be. His one long glimpse from thewreckage of the Merrick had suggested to Kassad that they were veryclose, perhaps only five or six hundred klicks above the surface, and inthe kind of parking orbit which he knew preceded the launching ofdropships.Kassad tried to wipe his face and frowned when the tips of loosegauntlet fingers tapped at his visor. He was tired. Hell, only a fewhours earlier he had been in fugue and just a few ship-weeks before thathe had almost certainly been body-dead.He wondered if the world below was Hyperion or Garden; he had been toneither but knew that Garden was more widely settled, closer to becominga Hegemony colony. He hoped it was Garden.The torchship launched three assault boats. Kassad saw them clearlybefore the aft camera panned beyond range. He tapped at the thrustercontrols until it felt as though the ship was tumbling more quicklytoward the wall of planet above. There was little else he could do.The squid reached atmosphere before the three Ouster assault boatsreached the squid. The boats undoubtedly were armed and well withinrange, but someone on the command circuit must have been curious. Orfurious.Kassad's squid was in no way aerodynamic. As with most ship-to-shipcraft, the squid could flirt with planetary atmospheres but was doomedif it dove too deeply into the gravity well. Kassad saw the telltalered glow of reentry, heard the ion buildup on the active radio channels,and suddenly wondered if this had been such a good idea.Atmospheric drag stabilized the squid and Kassad felt the firsttentative tug of gravity as he searched the console and the commandchair arms for the control circuit he prayed would be there. Astatic-filled video screen showed one of the dropships growing ablue-plasma tall as it decelerated. The illusion created was similar tothat encountered when one skydiver watched another open his chute oractivate his suspension rig; the assault boat seemed to climb suddenly.Kassad had other things to worry about. There seemed to be no obviousbail-out control, no ejection apparatus.Every FORCE:space shuttle carried some sort of atmospheric egressdevice- it was a custom dating back almost eight centuries to when theentire realm of space flight consisted only of tentative excursions justabove the skin of Old Earth's atmosphere. A ship-to-ship shuttleprobably would never need a planetary bail-out device, but age-old fearswritten into ancient regulations tended 'to die hard.Or so the theory went. Kassad could find nothing. The ship was quakingnow, spinning, and beginning to heat up in earnest. Kassad slapped openhis harness release and pulled himself toward the rear of the squid, noteven sure what he was looking for. Suspension packs? Parachutes?A set of wings?There was nothing in the troop carrier section except the corpse of theOuster pilot and a few storage compartments not much larger thanlunchboxes. Kassad tore through them, finding nothing bigger than amedkit. No miracle devices.Kassad could hear the squid shaking and beginning to break up as he hungon a pivot ring and all but accepted the fact that the Ousters had notwasted money or space on such low-probability rescue devices for theirsquids.Why should they? Their lifetimes were spent in the dark-nesses betweenstar systems; their concept of an atmosphere was the eight-klickpressurized tube of a can city.The external audio sensors on Kassad's bubble helmet began to pick upthe raging hiss of air on the hull and through the broken blister in theaft section. Kassad shrugged. He had gambled too many times and lost.The squid shuddered and bounced. Kassad could hear the manipulatortentacles tearing away from the bow.The Ouster's corpse suddenly was sucked up and out of the broken blisterlike an ant into a vacuum cleaner.Kassad clung to the pivot ring and stared through the open hatch at thecontrol seats in the cockpit. It struck him that they were wonderfullyarchaic, like something out of a textbook of the earliest spacecraft.Parts of the ship's exterior were burning away now, roaring past theobservation blisters like gobbets of lava. Kassad closed his eyes andtried to remember lectures from Olympus Command School on the structureand layout of ancient spacegoing craft. The squid began a terminaltumble.The noise was incredible.'By Allah!" gasped Kassad, a cry he had not uttered since childhood. Hebegan pulling himself forward into the cockpit, bracing himself on theopen hatch, finding handholds on the deck as if he were climbing avertical wall. He was climbing a wall. The squid had spun, stabilizedin a stern-first death dive. Kassad climbed under a 3-g load, knowingthat a single slip would break every bone in his body. Behind 'him,atmospheric hiss turned to a scream and then to a dragon roar. Thetroop carrier section was burning through in fierce, molten explosions.Climbing into the command seat was like negotiating a rock overhang withthe weight of two other climbers swinging from his back. The clumsygauntlets made his grip on the headrest even less sure as Kassad hungover the vertical drop to the flaming cauldron of the carriersection. The ship lurched, Kassad swung his legs up, and he was in thecommand seat. The display videos were dead. Flame heated the overheadblister to a sick red.Kassad almost lost consciousness as he bent forward, his fingers feelingin the darkness below the command seat, between his knees. There wasnothing. Wait... a hand-grip.No, sweet Christ and Allah . . . a D-ring. Something out of thehistory books.The squid began o break up. Overhead, the blister burned through andspattered liquid Perspex throughout the interior of the cockpit,splashing Kassad's suit and visor. He smelled plastic melting Thesquid was spinning as it broke up. Kassad's sight turned pink, dimmed,was gone. He used numb fingers to tighten the harness  . . tighter...either it was cutting into his chest or the Perspex had burned through.His hand went back to the D-ring. Fingers too clumsy to close aroundit... no.Pull.Too late. The squid flew apart in a final screech and explosion offlame, the control console tearing through the cockpit in ten thousandshrapnel-sized bits.Kassad was slammed into his seat. Up. Out. Into theheart of the flame.TumblingKassad was dimly aware that the seat was projecting its own containmentfield as it tumbled. Flame was centimeters from his face.Pyrobolts fired, kicking the ejection seat out of the squid's blazingslipstream. The command seat made its own track of blue flame acrossthe sky. Microprocessors spun the seat so that the disc of theforcefield was between Kassad and the furnace of friction. A giant saton Kassad's chest as he decelerated across two thousand kilometers ofsky at eight gravities.Kassad forced his eyelids open once, noted that he lay curled in thebelly of a long column of blue-white flame, and then he closed his eyesagain. He saw no sign of a control for a parachute, suspension pack, orany other braking device It didn't matter He could not move his armsor hands in any case.The giant shifted, grew heavierKassad realized that part of his helmet bubble had melted or been blownaway. The noise was indescribable.It didn't matter.He closed his eyes more tightly. It was a good time to take a nap.Kassad opened his eyes and saw the dark shape of a woman bending overhim. For a second he thought it was her. He looked again and realizedthat it was her. She touched his cheek with cool fingers.'Am I dead?" whispered Kassad, raising his own hand to grip her wrist.'No." Her voice was soft and throaty, burred with the hint of an accenthe could not place. He had never heardher speak before.'You're real?" 'Yes."Kassad sighed and looked around. He lay naked under a thin robe on somesort of couch or platform set in the middle of a dark, cavernous room.Overhead, starlight was visible through a broken roof. Kassad raisedhis other hand to touch her shoulder. Her hair was a dark nimbus abovehim. She wore a loose, thin gown which -even in the starlight - allowedhim to see the outlines of her body. He caught her scent, the fragranthint of soap and skin and her that he knew so well from their othertimes together.'You must have questions,' she whispered as Kassad released the goldclasp which held her gown in place. The gown whispered to the floor.She wore nothing underneath.Above them, the band of the Milky Way was clearly visible'No,' said Kassad and pulled her to him.Toward morning a breeze arose, and Kassad pulled the light cover overthem. The thin material seemed to preserve all of their body heat andthey lay together in perfect warmth. Somewhere sand or snow rasped atbare walls. The stars were very clear and very bright.They awoke at the first hint of dawn, their faces closetogether under the silken coverlet. She ran her handdown Kassad's side, finding old and recent scars.'Your name?" whispered Kassad.'Hush,' she whispered back, her hand sliding lower.Kassad moved his face into the scented curve of her neck. Her breastswere soft against him. Night paled to morning. Somewhere sand or snowblew against bare walls.They made love, slept, made love again. In full light they rose anddressed. She had laid out underwear, gray tunic and trousers forKassad. They fit perfectly, as did the spongesocks and soft hoots. Thewoman wore a similar outfit of navy blue.'Your name?" Kassad asked as they left the building with the shattereddome and walked through a dead city.'Moneta,' said his dream, 'or Mnemosyne, whichever name pleases youmore."'Moneta,' whispered Kassad. He looked up at a smallsun rising into a lapis sky. 'This is Hyperion?"'Yes."'How did I land? Suspensor field? Parachute?" 'You descended under awing of gold foil." 'I don't hurt. There were no wounds?" 'They weretended to." 'What is this place?"'The City of Poets. Abandoned more than a hundred years ago. Beyondthat hill lie the Time Tombs."'The Ouster assault boats that were following me?"'One landed nearby. The Pain Lord took the crew untohimself. The other two set down some distance away." 'Who is the PainLord?"'Come,' said Moneta. The dead city ended in desert.Fine sand slid across white marble half buried in dunes.To the west an Ouster dropship sat with its portals irised open. Nearby,on a fallen column, a thermcube yielded hot coffee and fresh-bakedrolls. They ate and drank in silence.Kassad worked to recall the legends of Hyperion. 'The Pain Lord is theShrike,' he said at last.'Of course."'You're from here... from the City of Poets?" Moneta smiled and slowlyshook her head.Kassad finished his coffee and set the cup down. The feeling that hewas in a dream persisted, much stronger than during any sim he had everparticipated in. But the coffee had tasted pleasantly bitter; the sunwas warm on his face and hands.'Come, Kassad,' said Moneta.They crossed expanses of cold sand. Kassad found himself glancingskyward, knowing that the Ouster torchship could lance them fromorbit... then knowing with a sudden certainty that it would not.The Time Tombs lay in a valley. A low obelisk glowed softly. A stonesphinx seemed to absorb the light. A complex structure of twistedpylons threw shadows onto itself. Other tombs were silhouettes againstthe rising sun. Each of the tombs had a door and each door was open.Kassad knew that they had been open when the first explorers discoveredthe Tombs and that the structures were empty. More than threecenturies of searching for hidden rooms, tombs, vaults, and passagewayshad been fruitless.'This is as far as you can go,' Moneta said as they neared the cliff atthe head of the valley. 'The time tides are strong today."Kassad's tactical implant was silent. He had no comlog. He searchedhis memory. 'There are anti entropic forcefields around the TimeTombs,' he said.'Yes."'The tombs are ancient. The anti-entropic fields keep them from aging."'No,' said Moneta. 'The time tides drive the Tombs backward throughtime."'Backward through time,' Kassad repeated stupidly.'Look."Shimmering, miragelike, a tree of steel thorns appeared out of the hazeand a sudden dust storm of ochre sand. The thing seemed to fill thevalley, rising at least two hundred meters to the height of the cliffs.Branches shifted, dissolved, and reformed like elements of a poorlytuned hologram. Sunlight danced on five meter-long thorns. Corpses ofOuster men and women, all naked, were impaled on at least a score ofthese thorns. Other branches held other bodies. Not all were human.The dust storm obscured the view for a moment and when the windssubsided the vision was gone. 'Come,' said Moneta.Kassad followed her through the fringes of the time tides, avoiding theebb and flow of the anti-entropic field the way children would play tagwith an ocean surf on a broad beach. Kassad felt the pull of the timetides like waves of ddjd vu tugging at every cell of his body.Just beyond the entrance to the valley, where hills opened to the dunesand low moors led to the City of Poets, Moneta touched a wall of blueslate and an entrance opened to a long, low room set into the cliffface.'Is this where you live?" asked Kassad but saw immediately that therewere no signs of habitation. The stone walls of the room were insetwith shelves and crowded niches.'We must ready ourselves,' whispered Moneta and the lighting shifted toa golden hue. A long rack lowered its wares. A wafer-thin strip ofreflective polymer curtained from the ceiling to serve as a mirror.Kassad watched with the calm passivity of a dreamer as Moneta strippedoff her clothes and then his. Their nudity was no longer erotic, merelyceremonial.'You have been in my dreams for years,' he told her.'Yes. Your past. My future. The shock wave of events moves acrosstime like ripples on a pond."Kassad blinked as she raised a gold ferule and touched his chest. Hefelt a slight shock and his flesh became a mirror, his head and face afeatureless ovoid reflecting all the color tones and textures of theroom. A second later Moneta joined him, her body becoming a cascade ofreflections, water over quicksilver over chrome.Kassad saw his own reflecting reflection in every curve and muscle ofher body. Moneta's breasts caught and bent the light; her nipples roselike small splashes on a mirrored pond. Kassad moved to embrace her andfelttheir surfaces flow together like magnetized fluid. Under the connectedfields, his flesh touched hers.'Your enemies await beyond the city,' she whispered.The chrome of her face flowed with light.'Enemies?"'The Ousters. The ones who followed you here."Kassad shook his head, saw the reflection do likewise.'They're not important anymore."'Oh, yes,' whispered Moneta, 'the enemy is always important. You mustarm yourself."'With what?" But even as he spoke, Kassad realized that she was touchinghim with a bronze sphere, a dull blue toroid. His altered body spoke tohim now as clearly as troops reporting in on an implant command circuit.Kassad felt the bloodlust build in him with turgid strength.'Come." Moneta led the way into open desert again.The sunlight seemed polarized and heavy. Kassad felt that they weregliding across the dunes, flowing like liquid through the white marblestreets of the dead city.Near the west end of town, near the shattered remnants of a structurestill bearing the inscribed lintel of Poets' Amphitheatre, somethingstood waiting.For a second Kassad thought it was another person wearing the chromiumforcefields he and Moneta were draped in - but only for a second. Therewas nothing human about this particular quicksilver-over-chromeconstruct. Kassad dreamily noted the four arms, retractablefingerblades, the profusion of thornspikes on throat, forehead, wrists,knees, and body, but not once did his gaze leave the twothousand-faceted eyes which burned with a red flame that paled sunlightand dimmed the day to blood shadows.The Shrike, thought Kassad.'The Lord of Pain,' whispered Moneta.The thing turned and led them out of the dead city.Kassad approved of the way the Ousters had prepared their defenses. Thetwo assault boats were grounded less than half a kilometer apart, theirguns, projectors, and missile turrets covering each other and a fullthreehundred and sixty degrees of fire. Ouster ground troops had been busydiing revetments a hundred meters out from the boats and Kassad couldsee at least two EM tanks hull down, their projection arrays and launchtubes commanding the wide, empty moor between the Poets' City and theboats. Kassad's vision had been altered; he could see the overlappingship containment fields as ribbons of yellow haze, the motion sensorsand antipersonnel mines as eggs of pulsing red light.He blinked, realizing that something was wrong with the image. Then itcame to him: besides the thickness of the light and his enhancedperception of energy fields, nothing was moving. The Ouster troops,even those set in attitudes of motion, were as stiff as the toy soldiershe had played with as a boy in the Thatsis slums. The EM tanks were duginto their hull-down positions, but Kassad noticed that now even theiracquisition radars - visible to him as concentric purple arcs - weremotionless.He glanced skyward and saw some sort of large bird hanging in the sky,as unmoving as an insect frozen in amber. He passed a cloud ofwindblown dust hanging suspended, extended one chrome hand, and flickedspirals of particles to the ground.Ahead of them, the Shrike strode casually through the red maze ofsensor-mines, stepped over the blue lines of tripbeams, ducked under theviolet pulses of the autofire scanners, passed through the yellowcontainment field and the green wall of the sonic defense perimeter, andwalked into the assault boat's shadow. Moneta and Kassad followed.--How is this possible? Kas,xi realized that he had posed the questionthrough a medium that was something less than telepathy but somethingfar more sophis ticated than implant conduction.--He controls time.-- The Pain Lord?--Of course.--Why are we here?Moneta gestured toward the motionless Ousters.-- They are your enemies.Kassad felt that he was finally awaking from a longdream. This was real. The Ouster trooper's eyes, unblinking behind hishelmet, were real. The Ouster assault boat, rising like a bronzetombstone to his left, was real.Fedmahn Kassad realized that he could kill them all -commandos, assaultboat crew, all of them- and they could do nothing about it. He knewthat time had not stopped - any more than it stopped while a ship wasunder Hawking drive - it was merely a matter of varying rates. The birdfrozen above them would complete the flap of its wings given enoughminutes or hours. The Ouster in front of him would close his eyes in ablink if Kassad had the patience to watch long enough. Meanwhile,Kassad and Moneta and the Shrike could kill all of them without theOusters realizing that they were under attack.It was not fair, Kassad realized. It was wrong. It was the ultimateviolation of the New Bushido, worse in its way than the wanton murder ofcivilians. The essence of honor lay in the moment of combat betweenequals. He was about to communicate this to Moneta when shesaid/thought -- Watch.Time began again with an explosion of sound not unlike the rush of airinto an airlock. The bird soared and circled overhead. A desert breezethrew dust against the static-charged containment field. An Oustercommando rose from one knee, saw the Shrike and the two human shapes,screamed something over his tactical comm channel, and raised his energyweapon.The Shrike did not seem to move - to Kassad it merely ceased being hereand appeared there. The Ouster commando emitted a second, shorterscream, and then looked down in disbelief as the Shrike's arm withdrewwith the man's heart in its bladed fist. The Ouster stared, opened hismouth as if to speak, and collapsed.Kassad turned to his right and found himself face to face with anarmored Ouster. The commando ponderously lifted a weapon. Kassad swunghis arm, felt the chrome forcefield hum, and saw the flat of his handcut through body armor, helmet, and neck. The Ouster's head rolled inthe dust.Kassad leaped into a low trench and saw several troopers begin to turn.Time was still out of joint; the enemy moved in extreme slow motion onesecond, jerked like a damaged holo to four-fifths speed in the nextinstant.They were never as quick as Kassad. Gone were his thoughts of the NewBushido. These were the barbarians who had tried to kill him. He brokeone man's back, stepped aside, jabbed rigid, chrome fingers through thebody armor of a second man, crushed the larynx of a third, dodged aknife blade moving in slow motion and kicked the spine out of the knifewielder. He leaped upout of the ditch.--Kassad!Kassad ducked as the laser beam crept past his shoulder, burning its waythrough the air like a slow fuse of ruby light. Kassad smelled ozone asit crackled past.Impossible. l've dodged a laser/He picked up a stone and flung it atthe Ouster manning the tank-mounted he!iwhip. A sonic boom cracked; thegunner exploded backward. Kassad pulled a plasma grenade from acorpse's bandolier, leaped to the tank hatch, was thirty meters awaybefore the explosion geysered flame as high as the assault boat's bow.Kassad paused in the eye of the storm to see Moneta in the center of herown circle of carnage. Blood splashed her but did not adhere, flowinglike oil on water across the rainbow curves of chin, shoulder, breast,and belly.She looked at him across the battlefield and Kassad felt a renewed surgeof bloodlust in himself.Behind her, the Shrike moved slowly through the chaos, choosing victimsas if he were harvesting. Kassad watched the creature wink in and outof existence and real'-d that to the Pain Lord he and Moneta wouldappear to be moving as slowly as the Ousters did to KassadoTime jumped, moved to four-fifths speed. The surviving troops werepanicking now, firing into one another, deserting their posts, andfighting to get aboard the assault boat. Kassad tried to realize whatthe past minute or two had been like for them: blurs moving throughtheir defensive positions, comrades dying ingreat gouts of blood. Kassad watched Moneta moving through their ranks,killing at her leisure. To his amazement, he discovered that he hadsome control of time: blink and his opponents slowed to one-third speed,blink and events moved at nearly their normal pace. Kassad's sense ofhonor and sanity called out for him to stop the slaughter but his almostsexual bloodlust overpowered any objections.Someone in the assault boat had sealed the airlock and now a terrifiedcommando used a shaped plasma charge to blow the portal open. The mobpressed in, trampling the wounded in their flight from unseen killers.Kassad followed them in.The phrase 'fight like a cornered rat' is an extremely apt description.Throughout the history of military encounters, human combatants havebeen known to fight at their fiercest when challenged in enclosed placeswhere flight is not an option. Whether in the passageways of La HayeSainte and Hougoumont at Waterloo or in the Hive tunnels of Lusus, someof the most terrible hand-to-hand battles in history have been fought incramped spaces where no retreat is possible. It was true this day. TheOusters fought... and died... like cornered rats.The Shrike had disabled the assault boat. Moneta remained outside tokill the threescore commandos who had stayed at their posts. Kassadkilled those within.In the end, the final assault boat fired on its doomed counterpart.Kassad was outside by then and he watched the particle beams andhigh-intensity lasers creep toward him, followed an eternity later bymissiles which seemed to move so slowly that he could have written hisname on them in flight. By that time all of the Ousters were dead inand around the overrun boat, but its containment field held. Energydispersion and impact explosions tossed corpses around on the outerperimeter, set fire to equipment, and glazed the sand to glass, butKassad and Moneta watched from inside a dome of orange flame as theremaining assault boat retreated to space.--Can we stop them? Kassad was panting, pouring sweat, and literallyquivering from excitement.-- We could, replied Moneta, but we do not want to.They will carry the message to the swarm.--Wt message?'Come here, Kassad?He turned at the sound of her voice. The reflective forcefield wasgone Moneta's flesh was oiled with sweat; her dark hair was mattedagainst her temples; her nipples were hard. 'Come here."Kassad glanced down at himself. His own forcefield was gone - he hadwilled it away - and he was moresexually excited than he could ever remember being.'Come here." Moneta whispered this timeKassad went to her, lifted her, felt the sweat-slick smoothness of herbuttocks as he carried her to an empty stretch of grass atop awind-carved hummock. He lowered her to the ground between piles ofOuster bodies, roughly opened her legs, took both her hands in the graspof one of his, lifted her arms above her head, pinned them to theground, and lowered his long body between her legs.'Yes,' whispered Morteta as he kissed the lobe of her left ear, set hislips to the pulse at the hollow of her neck, licked the salt tang ofsweat from her breasts. Lying among the dead. More dead to come. Thethousands.The millions. Laughter out of dead bellies. The long lines of troopsemerging from JumpShips to enter the waiting flames.'Yes." Her breath was hot in his ear. She freed her hands, slid themalong Kassad's damp shoulders, trailed long nails down his back, graspedhis buttocks to pull him closer. Kassad's erection scraped her pubichair, throbbed against the cusp of her belly. Farcaster portals openingto admit the cold lengths of attack carriers. The warmth of plasmaexplosions. Hundreds of ships, thousands, dancing and dying like dustmotes in a whirlwind.Great columns of solid ruby light lancing across great distances,bathing targets in the ultimate surge of warmth, bodies boiling in redlight.'Yes." Moneta opened her mouth and body to him.Warmth above and below, her tongue in his mouth as he entered her,.welcomed by warm friction. His bodystrained deep, pulled back slightly, allowed the moist warmth to engulfhim further as they began to move together. Heat on a hundred worlds.Continents burning in bright spasms, the roll of boiling seas. The airitself aflame. Oceans of superheated air swelling like warm skin risingto a lover's touch.'Yes... yes... yes." Moneta breathes warmth against his lips. Herskin is oil and velvet. Kassad thrusts quickly now, the universecontracting as sensation expands, senses dwindling as she closes warmand wet and tight around him. Her hips thrust harshly in response now,as if sensing the terrible build in pressure at the base of his being.Demanding. Kassad grimaces, closes his eyes, sees... . . fireballs expanding, stars dying, suns exploding in great pulsesof flame, star systems perishing in an ecstasy of destruction... ... he feels pain in his chest, his hips not stopping, moving faster,even as he opens his eyes and sees...... the great thorn of steel rising from between Moneta's breasts,almost impaling him as he unconsciously pulls up and back, thethornblade drawing blood which drips on her flesh, her pale flesh,reflective now, flesh as cold as dead metal, his hips still moving evenas he watches through passion-dimmed eyes as Moneta's lips wither andcurl back, revealing rows of steel blades where teeth had been, metalblades slash at his buttocks where fingers had gripped, legs likepowerful steel bands imprison his pumping hips, her eyes . ... in thelast seconds before orgasm Kassad tries to pull away . .his hands on her throat, pressing.. she clings like a leech, a lampreyready to drain him... they roll against dead bodies... . . her eyes like red jewels, blazing with a mad heat like thatwhich fills his aching testicles, expanding like a flame, spillingover. . . . Kassad slams both hands against the soil, lifts himself awayfrom her... from it... his strength insan but not enough as terriblegravities press them together...sucking like a lamprey's mouth as he threatens to explode, looks in hereyes . . the death of worlds... the death of worlds!Kassad screams and pulls away. Strips of his flesh rip away as helunges up and sideways. Metal teeth click shut in a steel vagina,missing his glans by a moist millimeter.Kassad slumps on his side, rolls away, hips moving, unable to stop hisejaculation. Semen explodes in streams, falls on the curled fist of acorpse. Kassad moans, rolls again, curls in a fetal position even as hecomes again. And again.He hears the hiss and rustle as she rises behind him.Kassad rolls on his back and squints up against sunlight and his ownpain. She stands above him, legs apart, a silhouette' of thorns. Kassadwipes sweat from his eyes, sees his wrist come away red with blood, andwaits for the killing blow. His skin contracts in anticipation of theslash of blade into flesh. Panting, Kassad looks up to see Moneta abovehim, thighs flesh rather than steel, her groin matted from the moistureof their passion. Her face is dark, the sun behind her, but he sees redflames dying in the multifaceted pits of her eyes. She smiles and hesees sunlight glint on rows of metal teeth. 'Kassad  . ." shewhispers and it is the sound of sand scraping against bone.Kassad tears his gaze away, struggles to his feet, and stumbles acrosscorpses and burning rubble in his terror to be free. He does not lookback.Scouting elements of Hyperion's Self-defense Force found Colonel FedmahnKassad almost two days later.He was discovered lying unconscious on one of the grassy moors whichlead to the abandoned Chronos Keep, some twenty kilometers from the deadcity and the wreckage of the Ouster ejection pod. Kassad was naked andalmost dead from the effects of exposure and several serious wounds, buthe responded well to emergency field treatment and was immediatelyairlifted south of the Bridle Range to a hospital at KeatsReconnaissance squads from the SDF battalion moved northward carefully,cautious of the anti-entropic tides around the Time Tombs and wary ofany booby traps left behind by the Ousters. There were none. Thescouts found only the wreckage of Kassad's escape mechanism and theburned out hulks of the two assault boats which the Ousters had lancedfrom orbit. There were no clues as to why they had slagged their ownships and the Ouster bodies-both in and around the boats - had beenburned beyond any hope of autopsy or analysis.Kassad regained consciousness three Hyperion days later, swore that heremembered nothing after stealing the squid, and was shipped out on aFORCE torchship two local weeks later.Upon returning to the Web, Kassad resigned his commission.For a while he was active in antiwar movements, occasionally appearingon the All Thing net arguing disarmament. But the attack on Bressia hadmobilized the Hegemony toward true interstellar war as had nothing elsein three centuries, and Kassad's voice was either drowned out ordismissed as the guilty conscience of the Butcher of South Bressia.In the sixteen years after Bressia, Colonel Kassad had disappeared fromthe Web and from the Web consciousness.Although there had been no more major battles, the Ousters remained theHegemony's prime bogeymen.Fedmahn Kassad was only a fading memory.It was late morning when Kassad finished his story. The Consul blinkedand looked around him, noticing the ship and its surroundings for thefirst time in more than two hours. The Benares had come out into themain channel of the Hoolie. The Consul could hear the creaks of thechains and hawsers as the river mantas surged against their harnesses.The Benares appeared to be the only ship heading upriver, but nownumerous small craft were visible going the other way. The Consulrubbed his forehead and was surprised to see his hand come away slickwith sweat. The day had grown very warm and the shadow of the tarp hadcrept away from the Consul without his noticing. He blinked, wipedsweat from his eyes, and moved into the shade to get a drink from one ofthe liquor bottles the androids had set in a cabinet near the table.'My God,' Father Hoyt was saying, 'so, according to this Monetacreature, the Time Tombs are moving backward in time?"'Yes,' said Kassad.'Is that possible?" asked Hoyt.'Yes." It was Sol Weintraub who answered.'If that's true,' said Brawne Lamia, 'then you "met" this Moneta... orwhatever her real name is... in her past but your future ... in ameeting that's still to come."'Yes,' said Kassad.Martin Silenus walked to the railing and spat into the river. 'Colonel,do you think the bitch was the Shrike?"'I don't know." Kassad's monotone was barely audible.Silenus turned to Sol Weintraub. 'You're a scholar. Is there anythingin the Shrike mythography that says the thing can change shape?"'No,' said Weintraub. He was preparing a milk globe to feed hisdaughter. The infant made soft, mewling noises and moved tiny fingers.'Colonel,' said Het Masteen, 'the forcefield... whatever the fightingsuit was... did you bring it with you after the encounter with theOusters and this ...female?"Kassad looked at the Templar a moment and then shook his head.The Consul was staring into his drink but his head suddenly snappedupright with the force of a thought.'Colonel, you said that you saw a vision of the Shrikc's killing tree...the structure, the thing where it impales its victims."Kassad moved his basilisk stare from the Templar to the Consul. Heslowly nodded.'And there were bodies on it?"Another nod.The Consul wiped sweat from his upper lip. 'If the tree is travelingbackward in time with the Time Tombs, then the victims are from ourfuture."Kassad said nothing. The others also were staring at the Consul now butonly Weintraub appeared to understand what the comment meant... andwhat the Con-su!'s next question had to be.The Consul resisted the urge to wipe the sweat from hislips again. His voice was steady. 'Did you see any of us there?"Kassad said nothing for more than a minute. The soft sounds of theriver and the ship's rigging suddenly seemed very loud. Finally Kassadtook a breath. 'Yes."Silence stretched again. Brawne Lamia broke it. 'Will you tell uswho?"'No." Kassad rose and went to the stairway leading to the lower decks.'Wait,' called Father Hoyt.Kassad paused at the head of the stairway.'Will you at least tell us two other things?" 'What?"Father Hoyt grimaced from a wave of pain. His gaunt face went whiteunder its film of perspiration. He took a breath and said, 'First, doyou think the Shrike... the woman... somehow wants to use you to startthis terrible interstellar war you foresaw?"'Yes,' Kassad said softly.'Second, will you tell us what you plan to petition the Shrike for... orthis Moneta... when you meet them on the pilgrimage?"Kassad smiled for the first time. It was a thin smile, and very, verycold. 'I will make no petition,' said Kassad. 'I will ask nothing ofthem. When I meet them this time, I will kill them:'The other pilgrims did not speak or look at one another as Kassad wentbelow. The Benares continued north-northeast into afternoon.THREEThe barge Benares entered the river port of Naiad an hour before sunset.Crew and pilgrims pressed to the rail to stare at smoldering embers ofwhat once had been a city of twenty thousand people. Little remained.The famous River Front Inn, built in the days of Sad King Billy, hadburned to the foundations; its charred docks, piers, and screenedbalconies now collapsed into the shallows of the Hoolie. Thecustomhouse was a burned-out shell. The airship terminal on the northend of town survived only as a blackened hulk, its mooring tower reducedto a spire of charcoal. There was no sign whatsoever of the smallriverfront Shrike temple. Worst of all, from the pilgrims' point ofview, was the destruction of the Naiad River Station - the harness docklay burned and sagging, the manta holding pens open to the river.'God damn it!" said Martin Silenus.'Who did it?" asked Father Hoyt. 'The Shrike?"'More likely the SDF,' said the Consul. 'Although they may have beenfighting the Shrike."'I can't believe this,' snapped Brawne Lamia. She turned to A. Bettik,who had just joined them on the rear deck. 'Didn't you know this hadhappened?"'No,' said the android. 'There has been no contact with any point northof the locks for more than a week."'Why the hell not?" asked Lamia. 'Even if this godforsaken worlddoesn't have a datasphere, don't you have radio?"A. Bettik smiled slightly. 'Yes, M. Lamia, there is radio, but thecomsats are down, the microwave repeater stations at the Karla Lockswere destroyed, and we have no access to shortwave."'What about'the mantas?" asked Kassad. 'Can we press on to Edge withthe ones we have."?"Bettik frowned. 'We will have to, Colonel,' he said.'But it is a crime. The two in harness will not recover from such apull. With fresh mantas we would have put into Edge before dawn. Withthese two..." The android shrugged. 'With luck, if the beasts survive,we will arrive by early afternoon..."'The windwagon will still be there, will it not?" asked Het Masteen.'We must assume so,' said A. Bettik. 'If you will excuse me, I willsee to feeding the poor beasts we have.We should be under way again within the hour."They saw no one in or near the ruins of Naiad. No river craft madetheir appearance above the city. An hour's pull northeast of the townthey entered the region where the forests and farms of the lower Hooliegave way to the undulating orange prairie south of the Sea of Grass.Occasionally the Consul would see the 'mud towers of architect ants,some of their serrated structures near the river reaching almost tenmeters in height. There was no sign of intact human habitation. Theferry at Betty's Ford was totally gone, with not even a towrope orwarming shack left to show where it had stood for almost two centuries.The River Runners Inn at Cave Point was dark and silent. A. Bettik andother crew members hallooed, but there was no response from the blackcave mouth.Sunset brought a sensuous stillness over the river, soon broken by achorus of insect noises and night-bird calls. For a while the surfaceof the Hoolie became a mirror of the gray-green disk of twilight sky,disturbed only by the leap of dusk-feeding fish and the wake of thelaboring mantas. As true darkness fell, innumerable prairie gossamers -much paler than their forest cousins, but also of greater wingspan,luminescent shades the size of small children - danced in the vales andvalleys of the gently rolling hills. By the time the constellationsemerged and the meteor trails began scarring the night sky, a brilliantdisplay this far from all man-made light, the lanterns had been lit anddinner set out on the aft deck.The Shrike pilgrims were subdued, as if still contemplating ColonelKassad's grim and confusing tale. The Consul had been drinking steadilysince before midday and now he felt the pleasant displacement - fromreality, from the pain of memory - which allowed him to get through eachday and night. Now he asked, his voice as careful and unslurred as onlya true alcoholic's can be, whose turn it was to tell a tale.'Mine,' said Martin Silenus. The poet also had been drinking steadilysince early in the day. His voice was as carefully controlled as theConsul's but redness on his sharp cheeks and an almost manic brightnessof eye gave the old poet away. 'At least I drew number three..." Heheld up his slip of paper. 'If you still want to hear the fuckingthing."Brawne Lamia lifted her glass of wine, scowled, and set it down.'Perhaps we should talk about what we have learned from the first twostories and how it might relate to our current... situation."'Not yet,' said Colonel Kassad. 'We don't have enough information."'Let M. Silenus speak,' said Sol Weintruab. 'Then wecan begin discussing what we have heard."'I agree,' said Lenar Hoyt.Het Mastcen and the Consul nodded.'Agreed!" cried Martin Silenus. 'I'11 tell my story. Just let mefinish my fucking glass of wine."THE POET'S TALE: 'Hyperion Cantos'In the beginning was the Word. Then came the fucking word processor.Then came the thought processor. Then came the death of literature. Andso it goes.Francis Bacon once said, 'There arises from a bad and unapt formation ofwords a wonderful obstruction to the mind." We have all contributed ourwonderful obstructions to the mind, have we not? I more than most. Oneof the twentieth century's better, forgotten writers- that isbetter-comma-forgotten, once bonrnoted: 'i love being a writer. It's the paperwork I can't stand." Getit? Well, amigos and amigette, I love being apoet. It's the goddamned words I can't stand.Where to start?Start with Hyperion perhaps?(Fade in) Almost two standard centuries ago.Sad King Billy's five seedships spin like gold dandelions above this alltoo familiar lapis sky. We land like conquistadors strutting to andfro; more than two thousand visual artists and writers and sculptors andpoets and ARNists and vid makers and holie directors and composers anddecomposers and God knows what all, supported by five times that manyadministrators and technicians and ecologists and supervisors and courtchamberlains and professional ass kissers, not to mention the family ofroyal asses themselves, supported in turn by ten times that manyandroids willing to till the soil and stoke the reactors and raise thecities and lift that bale and tote that load... hell, you get the idea.We landed on a world already seeded by the poor buggers who'd goneindigenie two centuries before and were living hand to mouth and cudgelto brain wherever they could. Naturally the noble descendants of thesebrave pioneers greeted us like gods - especially after a few of oursecurity folk slagged a few of their more aggressive leaders- andnaturally we accepted their worship as our due and put them to work nextto our blueskins, plowing the south forty and working to build ourshining city on the hill.And it was a shining city on a hill. Seeing the ruins today can tellyou nothing of the place. The desert had advanced in three centuries;the aqueducts from the mountains have fallen and shattered; the cityitself is only bones. But in its day the City of Poets was fair indeed,a bit of Socrates's Athens with the intellectual excitement ofRenaissance Venice, the artistic fervor of Paris in the days of theImpressionists, the true democracy of the first decade of Orbit City,and the unlimited future of Tau Ceti Center.But, in the end, it was none of these things, of course.It was only Hrothgar's claustrophobic mead hall withthe monster waiting in the darkness without. We had our Grendel, to besure. We even had our Hrothgar if one squints a bit at Sad King Billy'spoor slouched profile.We lacked only our Geats; our great, broad-shouldered, small-brainedBeowulf with his band of merry psycho-paths.So, lacking a Hero, we settled into the role of victims and composed oursonnets and rehearsed our ballets and unrolled our scrolls, while allthe while our thorn-and-steel Grendel served the night with fear andharvested thighbones and gristle.And this was when I - a satyr then, formed in flesh as mirror to my soul- came as close to completing my Cantos, my life's work, as I have comein five sad centuries ofstubborn continuance.(Fade to black)It occurs to me that the Grendel tale is premature. The players havenot been brought upon the stage. Dislinear plotting and non-contiguousprose have their adherents, not the least of which am I, but in the end,my friends, it is character which wins or loses immortality upon thevellum. Haven't you ever harbored the secret thought that somewhereHuck and Jim are- at this instant-poling their raft down some river justbeyond our reach, so much more real are they than the shoe clerk whofitted us just a forgotten day ago? At any rate, if this fuckingstory's to be told, you should know who's in it. So --as much as itpains me - VII back up to begin at the beginning.In the beginning was the Word. And the Word was programmed in classicbinary. And the Word said, 'Let there be life!" And so, somewhere inthe TechnoCore vaults of my mother's estate, frozen sperm from mylong-dead daddy was defrosted, set in suspension, shaken like thevanilla malts of yore, loaded into something part squirt gun and partdildo, and - at the magic touch of a trigger - ejaculated into Mother ata time when the moon was full and the egg was ripe.Mother didn't have to be impregnated in this barbaric fashion, ofcourse. She could have chosen ex utero fertilization, a male lover witha transplant of Daddy'sDNA, a clonal surrogate, a gene-spliced virgin birth, you name it...but, as she told me later, she opened her legsto tradition. My guess is that she preferred it that way.Anyway, I was born.I was born on Earth... Old Earth... and fuck you, Lamia, if you don'tbelieve it. We lived on Mother's estate on an island not far from theNorth American Preserve.Notes for sketch of home on Old Earth:Fragile twilights fading from violet to fuchsia to purple above thecrepe-paper silhouettes of trees beyond the southwest sweep of lawn.Skies as delicate as translucent china, unscarred by cloud or contrail.The presymphony hush of first light followed by the cymbal crash ofsunrise. Oranges and russets igniting to gold, the long, cool descentto green: leaf shadow, shade, tendrils of cypress and weeping willow,the hushed green velvet of the glade.Mother's estate - our estate - a thousand acres centered in a millionmore. Lawns the size of small prairies with grass so perfect itbeckoned a body to lie on it, to nap on its soft perfection. Nobleshade trees making sundials of the Earth, their shadows circling instately procession; now mingling, now contracting to midday, finallystretching eastward with the dying of the day.Royal oak. Giant elms. Cottonwood and cypress and redwood and bonsai.Banyan trees lowering new trunks like smooth-sided columns in a templeroofed by sky.Willows lining carefully laid canals and haphazard streams, theirhanging branches singing ancient dirges to the wind.Our house rises on a low hill where, in the winter, the browning curvesof lawn look like the smooth flank of some female beast, all thighmuscle and meant for speed.The house shows its centuries of accretion: a jade tower on the eastcourtyard catching the first light of dawn, a series of gables on thesouth wing throwing triangles of shadow on the crystal conservatory atteatime, the balconies and maze of exterior stairways along the eastporticoes playing Escher games with afternoon's shadows.It was after the Big Mistake but before everything grew uninhabitable.Mostly we occupied the estate during what we quaintly called 'periods ofremission'-stretches of ten to eighteen quiet months between planet-widespasms as the Kiev Team's goddamn little black hole digested bits of theEarth's center and waited for its next feast. During the 'Bad Times,'we vacationed at Uncle Kowa's place out beyond the moon, on aterra-formed asteroid brought there before the Ouster migration.You might already be able to tell that I was born with a silver spoon upmy ass. I offer no apologies. After three thousand years of dabblingwith democracy, the remaining Old Earth families had come to therealization that the only way to avoid such riffraff was not to allowthem to breed. Or, rather, to sponsor seedship fleets; spinshipexplorations, new farcaster migrations ... all of the panicked urgencyof the Hegira... as long as they bred out there and left Old Earthalone. The fact that the homeworld was a diseased old bitch, gone inthe teeth, didn't hurt the riffraff's urge to pioneer. No fools they.And like the Buddha, I was almost grown before I saw my first hint ofpoverty. I was sixteen standard years old, on my Wanderjahr, andbackpacking through India when I saw a beggar. The Hindu Old Familieskept them around for religious reasons, but all I knew at the time wasthat here was a man in rags, ribs showing, holding out a wicker basketwith an ancient credit diskey in it, begging for a touch of my universalcard. My friends thought it was hysterical. I threw up. It was inBenares.My childhood was privileged but not obnoxiously so. I have pleasantmemories of Grande Dame Sybil's famous parties (she was a great-aunt onmy mother's side). 1 remember one three-day affair she threw in theManhattan Archipelago, guests ferried in by dropship from Orbit City andfrom the European arcologies. I remember the Empire State Buildingrising from the water, its many lights reflecting on the lagoons andfern canals; the EMVs unloading passengers on the observation deck whilecooking fires burned on the overgrown island mounds of lower buildingsall around.The North American Preserve was our private playground in those days. Itwas said that about eight thousand people still resided in thatmysterious continent, but half of these were rangers. The rest includedthe renegade ARNists who plied their trade by resurrecting species ofplants and animals long absent from their antediluvian North Americanhaunts, the ecology engineers, licensed primitives such as the OgalallaSioux or the He!l's Angel Guild, and the occasional tourist. I had acousin who reportedly backpacked from one observation zone to the otherin the Preserve, but he did so in the Midwest where the zones wererelatively close together and where the dinosaur herds were muchscarcer.In the first century after the Big Mistake, Gaea was mortally injuredbut slow in the dying. The devastation was great during the Bad Times -and these came more often in precisely plotted spasms, shorterremissions, more terrible consequences after each attack - but the Earthabided and repaired itself as best it could.The Preserve was, as I say, our playground but, in a real sense, so wasall of the dying Earth. Mother let me have my own EMV when I was sevenand there was no place on the globe farther than an hour's flight fromhome. My best friend, Amalfi Schwartz, lived in the Mount ErebusEstates in what had once been the Antarctic Republic. We saw each otherdaily. The fact that Old Earth law forbade farcasters did not bother usin the least; lying on some hillside at night looking up through the tenthousand Orbiting Lights and the twenty thousand beacons of the Ring, atthe two or three thousand visible stars, we felt no jealousy, no urge tojoin the Hegira that even then was spinning the farcaster silk of theWorldweb. We were happy.My memories of Mother are oddly stylized, as if she were anotherfictional construct from one of my Dying Earth novels. Perhaps she was.Perhaps I was raised by robots in the automated cities of Europe,suckled by androids in the Amazon Desert, or simply grown in a vat likebrewer's yeast. What I recall is Mother's white gown sliding ghostlikethrough the shadowed rooms of the estate; infinitely delicate blue veinson the back of herthin-fingered hand as she poured tea in the damask and dust light of theconservatory; candlelight caught like a gold fly in the spiderweb sheenof her hair, hair done up in a bun in the style of the Grandes Dames.Sometimes 1 dream that I remember her voice, the lilt and tone andturn-in-the-womb centerhess of it, but then I awake and it becomes onlythe wind moving lace curtains or the sound of some alien sea on stone.From my earliest sense of self, I knew that I would be - should be - apoet. It was not as if I had a choice; more like the dying beauty allabout breathed its last breath in me and commanded that I be doomed toplay with words the rest of my days, as if in expiation for our race'sthoughtless slaughter of its crib world. So what the hell; I became apoet.I had a tutor whose name was Balthazar, human but ancient, a refugeefrom ancient Alexandria's flesh-scented alleys. Balthazar all butglowed blue-white from those crude, early Poulsen treatments; he waslike an irradiated mummy of a man, sealed in liquid plastic.And randy as the proverbial goat. Centuries later, when I was in mysatyr period, I felt that I finally understood poor don Balthazar'spriapic compulsions, but in those days it was mostly a hindrance tokeeping young girls on the estate's staff. Human or android, donBaitbazar did not discriminate - he poinked them all.Luckily for my education, there was nothing homosexual in donBalthazar's addiction to young flesh, so his escapades evidencedthemselves either as absences from our tutorial sessions or aninordinate amount of attention lavished on memorizing verses from Ovid,Senesh, or Wu.He was an excellent tutor. We studied the ancients and the lateclassical period, took field trips to the ruins of Athens, Rome, London,and Hannibal, Missouri, and never once had a quiz or test. DonBalthazar expected me to learn everything by heart at first encounterand I did not disappoint him. He convinced my mother that the pitfallsof 'progressive education' were not for an Old Earth family, so ! neverknew the mind-stunting shortcuts of RNA medication, datasphereimmersion,systemic flashback training, stylized encounter groups, 'higher-levelthinking skills' at the expense of facts, or preliterate programming. Asa result of these deprivations, I was able to recite all of Fitzgerald'stranslation of the Odyssey by the time I was six, compose a sestinabefore I could dress myself, and think in spiral fugue-verse before Iever interfaced with an AI.My scientific education, on the other hand, was something less thanstringent. Don Balthazar had little interest in what he referred to as'the mechanical side of the universe." I was twenty-two before Irealized that computers, RMUs, and Uncle Kowa's asteroidal life-supportdevices were machines and not some benevolent manifestations of theanimas around us. I believed in fairies, woodsprites, numerology,astrology, and the magic of Midsummer's Eve deep in the primitiveforests of the NAP. Like Keats and Lamb in Haydon's studio, donBalthazar and 1 drank toasts to 'the confusion of mathematics' anclmourned the destruction of' the poetry of the rainbow by M. Newton'sprying prism.. The early distrust and actual hatred of all thingsscientific and clinical served me well in later life. It is notdifficult, 1 have learned, to remain a pre-Copernican pagan in thepostscientific Hegemony.My early poetry was execrable. As with most bad poets, I was unaware ofthis fact, secure in my arrogance that the very act of creating gavesome worth to the worthless abortions I was spawning. My motherremained tolerant even as I left reeking little piles of doggerel lyingaround the house. She was indulgent of her only child even if he was asblithely incontinent as an unhousebroken llama.Don Balthazar never commented on my work; primarily, I assume, because Inever showed him any of it. Don Baithazar thought that the venerableDaton was a fraud, that Salmud Brevy and Robert Frost should have hangedthemselves with their own entrails, that Wordsworth was a fool, and thatanything less than Shakespeare's sonnets was a profanation of thelanguage. I saw no reason to bother don Baitbazar with my verse, rifewith budding genius though I knew it to be.I published several of these little literary turds in the varioushardcopy journals then in vogue in the various arcologies of theEuropean Houses, the amateur editors of these crude journals being asindulgent of my mother as she was of me. Occasionally I would pressAmalfi or one of my other playmates - less aristocratic than I and thuswith access to the datasphere or fatline transmitters - to uplink someof my verses to the Ring or to Mars, and thus to the burgeoningfarcaster colonies.They never replied. I assumed they were too busy.Belief in one's identity as a poet or writer prior to the acid test ofpublication is as naive and harmless as the youthful belief in one'simmortality... and the inevitable disillusionment is just as painful.My mother died with Old Earth. About half the Old Families stayedduring that last cataclysm; I was twenty years old then and had made myown romantic plans to die with the homeworld. Mother decided otherwise.What concerned her was not my premature demise - like me, she was fartoo self-centered to think of someone else at a time like that - noreven the fact that the death of my DNA would mark the end of a line ofaristocrats which stretched back to the Mayflower;, no, what botheredMother was that the family was going to die out in debt. Our lasthundred years of extravagance, it seems, had been financed throughmassive loans from the Ring Bank and other discreet extraterrestrialinstitutions.Now that the continents of Earth were crashing under the impact ofcontraction, the great forests aflame, the oceans heaving and heatingthemselves into a lifeless soup, the very air transforming itself intosomething too hot and thick to break and too thin to plow, now the bankswanted their money back. I was collateral.Or, rather, Mother's plan was. She liquidated all available assets someweeks before that phrase became a literal reality, deposited a quarterof a million marks in long-term accounts in the fleeing Ring Bank, anddispatched me on a trip to the Rifkin Atmospheric Protectorate onHeaven's Gate, a minor world circling the star Vega. Even then, thatpoisonous world had afarcaster connection to Sol System, but I did not farcast.Nor was I a passenger on the single spinship with Hawking drive whichput into Heaven's Gate each standard year. No, Mother sent me to thisback end of the outback on a Phase Three ramship, slower than light,frozen with the cattle embryos and orange juice concentrate and feederviruses, on a trip that took one hundred and twenty-nine shipboardyears, with an objective time-debt of one hundred and sixty-sevenstandard years!Mother figured that the accrued interest on the long-term accounts wouldbe enough to pay off our family debt and perhaps allow me to survivecomfortably for a while. For the first and last time in her life,Mother figured wrong.Notes for a sketch of Heaven's Gate:Mud lanes which run back from the station's conversion docks like apattern of sores on a leper's back.Sufrus-brown clouds which hang in tatters from a rotten burlap sky. Atangle of shapeless wooden structures half decayed before they were everfully constructed, their paneless windows now staring sightlessly intothe gaping mouths of their neighbors. lndigenies breeding like...like humans, I suppose ... eyeless cripples, lungs burned out with airrot, squiring a nest of a dozen offspring, the children's skin scabrousby age five-standard, their eyes watering incessantly from the sting ofan atmosphere which will kill them before they're forty, their smilescarious, their oily hair rife with lice and the blood bags of draculaticks. Proud parents beaming. Twenty million of these doomed schmucks,crowded into slums overflowing an island smaller than my family's westlawn on Old Earth, all of them fighting to breathe the only breathableair on a world where the standard is to inhale and die, crowding evercloser to the center of the sixty-mile radius of survivable atmospherewhich the Atmospheric Generating Station had beenable to provide before it began to malfunction.Heaven's Gate: my new home.Mother had not taken into account the possibility that all Old Earthaccounts would be frozen- and thenappropriated into the growing Worldweb economy. Nor had she rememberedthat the reason people had waited for the Hawking drive to see thespiral arm of the galaxy is that in long-term cryogenic sleep - asopposed to a few weeks or months of fugue - chances of terminal braindamage were one in six. I was lucky. When I was uncrated on Heaven'sGate and put to work digging out acid canals beyond the perimeter, I hadsuffered only a cerebral accident - a stroke. Physically, I was able towork in the mud pits within a few local weeks. Mentally, there was muchleft to be desired.The left side of my brain had been shut down like a damaged section of aspinship being sealed off, airtight doors leaving the doomedcompartments open to vacuum. I could still think. Control of the rightside of my body soon returned. Only the language centers had beendamaged beyond simple repair. The marvelous organic computer wedged inmy skull had dumped its language content like a flawed program. Theright hemisphere was not without some language - but only the mostemotionally charged units of communication could lodge in that affectivehemisphere; my vocabulary was now down to nine words. (This, I learnedlater, was exceptional, many victims of CVAs retain only two or three.)For the record, here is my entire vocabulary of manageable words: fuck,shit, piss, cunt, goddamn, motherfucker, asshole, peepee, and poopoo.A quick analysis will show some redundancy here. I had at my disposaleight nouns, which stood for six things; five of the eight nouns coulddouble as verbs. I retained one indisputable noun and a singleadjective which also could be used as a verb or expletive. My newlanguage universe was comprised of four monosyllables, three compoundwords, and two baby-talk repetitions.My arena of literal expression offered four avenues to the topic ofelimination, two references to human anatomy, one request for divineimprecation, one standard description of or request for coitus, and acoital variation which was no longer an option for me since my motherwas deeeased.All in all, it was enough.I will not say that I remember my three years in the mud pits and slimeslums of Heaven's Gate with fondnexs, but it is true that these yearswere at least as formative as - and probably more so than - my previoustwo decades on Old Earth.I soon found that among my intimate acquaintances - Old Sludge, thescoop-shovel foreman; Unk, the slum-yard bully to whom I paid myprotection bribes; Kiti, the lice-ridden crib doxy whom I slept withwhen I could afford it - my vocabulary served me well. 'Shit-fuck,' Iwould grunt, gesticulating. 'Asshole cunt peepec fuck."'Ah,' grinned Old Sludge, showing his one tooth, 'going to the companystore to get some algae chewies, huh?"'Goddamn poopoo,' I would grin back at him.The life of a poet lies not merely in the finite language-dance ofexpression but in the nearly infinite combinations of perception andmemory combined with the sensitivity to what is perceived andremembered. My three local years on Heaven's Gate, almost fifteenhundred standard days, allowed me to see, to feel, to hear -to remember,as if I literally had been born again. Little matter that I had beenborn again in hell; reworked experience is the stuff of all true poetryand raw experience was the birthing gift of my new life.There was no problem adapting to a brave new world a century and a halfbeyond my own. For all of our talk of expansion and pioneering spiritthese past five centuries, we all know how stultified and static ourhuman universe has become. We are in a comfortable Dark Ages of theinventive mind; institutions change but little, and that by gradualevolution rather than revolution; scientific research creeps crablike ina lateral shuffle, where once it leaped in great intuitive bounds;devices change even less, plateau technologies common to us would beinstantly identifiable- and operable!- to our great-grandfathers.So while I slept the Hegemony became a formal entity, the Worldweb wasspun to something close to its final shape, the All Thing took itsdemocratic place among the list of humanity's benevolent despots, theTechnoCore seceded from human service and then offered its help as anally rather than a slave, and the Ousters retreated to darkness and therole of Nemesis  . . but all these things had been creeping towardcritical mass even before I was frozen into my ice coffin between thepork bellies and sherbet, and such obvious extensions of old trends tooklittle effort to understand. Besides, history viewed from the inside isalways a dark, digestive mess, far different from the easilyrecognizable cow viewed from afar by historians.My life was Heaven's Gate and the minute-to-minute demands of survivalthere. The sky was always an eternal yellow-brown sunset hanging like acollapsing ceiling mere meters above my shack. My shack was oddlycomfortable: a table for eating, a cot for sleeping and fucking, a holefor pissing and shitting, and a window for silent staring. Myenvironment mirrored my vocabulary.Prison always has been a good place for writers, killing, as it does,the twin demons of mobility and diversion, and Heaven's Gate was noexception. The Atmospheric Protectorate owned my body but my mind - orwhat was left of it - was mine.On Old Earth, my poetry was composed on a Sadu-Dekenar cornlog thoughtprocessor while I lounged in a padded chaise 1ongue or floated in my EMbarge above dark lagoons or walked pensively through scented bowers.The execrable, undisciplined, limp-wristed flatulent products of thosereveries already have been described.On Heaven's Gate, I discovered what a mental stimulant physical laborcould be; not mere physical labor, 1 should add, but absolutelyspine-bending, lung-racking, gut-ripping, ligament-tearing, andball-breaking physical labor. But as long as the task is both onerousand repetitive, I discovered, the mind is not only free to wander tomore imaginative climes, it actually flees to higher planes.Thus, on Heaven's Gate, as I dredged bottom scum from the slop canalsunder the red gaze of Vega Primo or crawled on hands and knees throughstalactites andstalagmites of rebreather bacteria in labyrinthine lungpipes, I became apoet.All I lacked were the words.the station'sThe twentieth century's most honored writer, William Gass, once said inan interview; 'Words are the supreme objects. They are minded things."And so they are. As pure and transcendent as any Idea which ever cast ashadow into Plato's dark cave of our perceptions. But they are alsopitfalls of deceit and misperception. Words bend our thinking toinfinite paths of self-delusion, and the fact that we spend most of ourmental lives in brain mansions built of words means that we lack theobjectivity necessary to see the terrible distortion of reality whichlanguage brings. Example: the Chinese pictogram for 'integrity' is atwo-part symbol of a man literally standing next to his word. So far,so good. But what does the Late English word 'honesty' mean? Or'Motherland'? Or 'progress'7 Or 'democracy'?Or 'beauty'? But even in our self-deception, we become gods.A philosopher/mathematician named Bertrand Russell, who lived and diedin the same century as Gass, once wrote: 'Language serves not only toexpress thought but to make possible thoughts which could not existwithout it." Here is the essence of mankind's creative genius: not theedifices of civiliz.tion nor the bang-flash weapons which can end it,but the words which fertilize new concepts like spermatazoa attacking anovum. It might be argued that the Siamese-twin infants of word/idea arethe only contribution the human species can, will, or should make to thereveling cosmos.(Yes, our DNA is unique but so is a salamander's. Yes, we constructartifacts but so have species ranging from beavers to the architect antswhose crenellated towers are visible right now off the port bow. Yes,we weave real-fabric things from the dreamstuff of mathematics, but theuniverse is hardwired with arithmetic. Scratch a circle and :r peepsout. Enter a new solar system and Tycho Brahe's formulae lie waitingunder the black velvet cloak of space/time. But where has the universehidden a wordunder its outer layer of biology, geometry, or insensate rock?) Even thetraces of other intelligent life we have found - the blimps on Jove II,the Labyrinth Builders, the Seneschai empaths on Hebron, the StickPeople of Durulis, the architects of the Time Tombs, the Shrike itself -have left us mysteries and obscure artifacts but no language. No words.The poet John Keats once wrote to a friend of his named Bailey: 'I amcertain of nothing but the holiness of the Heart's affections and thetruth of Imagination - What the imagination seizes as Beauty must betruth - whether it existed before or not."The Chinese poet George Wu, who died in the Last Sino-Japanese War aboutthree centuries before the Hegira, understood this when he recorded onhis comlog: 'Poets are the mad midwives to reality. They see not whatis, nor what can be, but what must become." Later, on his last disk tohis lover the week before he died, Wu said: 'Words are the only bulletsin truth's bandolier. And poets are the snipers."You see, in the beginning was the Word. And the Word was made flesh inthe weave of the human universe.And only the poet can expand this universe, finding shortcuts to newrealities the way the Hawking drive tunnels under the barriers ofEinsteinian space/time.To be a poet, I realized, a true poet, was to become the Avatar ofhumanity incarnate; to accept the mantle of poet is to carry the crossof the Son of Man, to suffer the birth pangs of the Soul-Mother ofHumanity.To be a true poet is to become God.I tried to explain this to my friends on Heaven's Gate.'Piss, shit,' I said. 'Asshole motherfucker, goddamn shit goddamn.Cunt. Peepee cunt. Goddamn!'They shook their heads and smiled, and walked away.Great poets are rarely understood in their own day.The yellow-brown clouds rained acid on me. I waded in mud up to mythighs and cleaned leechweed from the city sewer pipes. Old Sludge diedduring my second year there when we were all working on a projectextending the First Avenue Canal to the Midsump Mudflats. Anaccident. He was climbing a slime dune to rescue a single sulfur-rosefrom the advancing grouter when there was a mudquake. Kiti marriedshortly after that. She still worked part time as a crib doxy, but Isaw less and less of her. She died in childbirth shortly after thegreen tsunami carried away Mudflat City. I continued to write poetry.How is it, you might ask, that someone can write fine verse with avocabulary of only nine right-hemisphere words?The answer is that I used no words at all. Poetry is only secondarilyabout words. Primarily, it is about tuth. I dealt with the Ding an$ih, the substance behind the shadow, weaving powerful concepts,similes, and connections the way an engineer would raise a skyscraperwith the whiskered-alloy skeleton being constructed long before theglass and plastic and chromaluminum appears.And slowly the words returned. The brain retrains and retools itselfamazingly well. What had been lost in the left hemisphere found a homeelsewhere or reasserted their primacy in the damaged regions likepioneers returning to a fire-damaged plain made more fertile by theflames. Where before a simple word like 'salt' would leave mestuttering and. gasping, my mind probing emptiness like a tongueprodding the socket of a missing tooth, now the words and phrases flowedback slowly, like the names of forgotten playmates. During the day Ilabored in the slimefields, but at night I sat at my splintered tableand wrote my Cantos by the light of a hissing ghee lamp. Mark Twainonce opined in his homey way: 'The difference between the right word andthe almost right word is the difference between lightning and thelightning bug." He was droll but incomplete.During those long months of beginning my Cantos on Heaven's Gate, Idiscovered that the difference between finding the right word as opposedto accepting the almost right word was the difference between beingstruck by lightning and merely watching a lightning display.So my Cantos began and grew. Written on the flimsy sheets of recycledleechweed fiber which they issued bythe ton for use as toilet paper, scribbled by one of the cheap felt-tippens sold at the Company Store, the Cantos took shape. As the wordsreturned, slipping into place like once scattered pieces of a 3-Dpu:,le, I needed a form. Returning to don Baithazar's teachings, 1tried on the measured nobility of Milton's epic verse. Gainingconfidence, I added the romantic sensuality of a Byron matured by aKeatsish celebration of the language. Stirring all this, I seasoned themixture with a dash of Yeats's brilliant cynicism and a pinch of Pound'sobscure, scholastic arrogance. I chopped, diced, and added suchingredients as Eliot's control of imagery, Dylan Thomas's feel forplace, Delmore Schwartz's sense of doom, Steve Tem's touch of horror,Salmud Brevy's plea for innocence; Daton's love of the convoluted rhymescheme, Wu's worship of the physical, and Edmond Ki Fererra's radicalplayfulness.In the end, of course, I threw this entire mixture out and wrote theCantos in a style all my own.If it had not been for Unk the slumyard bully, I probably still would beon Heaven's Gate, digging acid canals by day and writing Cantos bynight.It was my day off and I was carrying my Cantos - the only copy of mymanuscript! - to the Company Library in the Common Hall to do someresearch when Unk and two of his cronies appeared from an alley anddemanded immediate payment of the next month's protection money. We hadno universal cards in the Heaven's Gate Atmospheric Protectorate; wepaid our debts in company scrip or bootleg marks. I had neither. Unkdemanded to see what was in my plastic shoulder bag.Without thinking, I refused. It was a mistake. If I'd shown Unk themanuscript, he most probably would have scattered it in the mud andslapped me around after making threats. As it was, my refusal angeredhim so he and his two Neanderthal companions tore open the bag,scattered the manuscript in the mud, and beat me within the proverbialinch of my life.It so happened that on this day an EMV belonging to a Protectorate airquality control manager was passinglow above and the wife of the manager, traveling alone to the arc'sCompany Residential Store, ordered the EMV down, had her android servantretrieve me and what was left of my Cantos, and then personally drove meto the Company Hospital. Normally, the members of the bonded work forcereceived medical aid, if any, at the walk-in Bio Clinic, but thehospital did not want to refuse the wife of a manager so I was admitted- still unconscious - and watched over by a human doctor and themanager's wife while I recovered in a healing tank.All right, to make a banal long story into a banal short story, I'll cutto the uplink. Helenda - that was the manager's wife - read mymanuscript while I was floating in renewal nutrient. She liked it. Onthe same day I was being decanted in the Company Hospital, Helendafarcast to Renaissance where she showed my Cantos to her sister Felia,who had a friend whose lover knew an editor at Transline Publishing.When I awoke the next day, my broken ribs had been set, my shatteredcheekbone had been healed, my bruises were gone, and I'd received fivenew teeth, a new cornea for my left eye, and a contract with Transline.My book came out five weeks later. A week after that, Helenda divorcedher manager and married me. It was her seventh marriage, my first. Wehoneymooned on the Concourse and, when we returned a month later, mybook had sold more than a billion copies - the first book of verse tohit the bestseller lists in four centuries - and I was a millionairemany times over.Tyrena Wingreen-Feif was my first editor at Transline. It was her ideato title the book The Dying Earth (a records search showed a novel bythat name five hundred years earlier, but the copyright had lapsed andthe book was out of print). It was her idea to publish just thesections of the Cantos which dealt with the nostalgic final days of OldEarth. And it was her idea to remove the sections which she thoughtwould bore the readers - the philosophical passages, the descriptions ofmy mother, the sections which paid homage to earlier poets, the placeswhere I played with experimental verse, the more personalpassages - everything, in fact, except the descriptions of the idyllicfinal days which, emptied of all heavier freight, came across assentimental and insipid. Four months after publication The Dying Earthhad sold two and a half billion hardfax copies, an abridged anddigitalized version was available on the See Thing datasphere, and ithad been optioned for the holies.Tyrena pointed out that the timing had been perfect...that the original trauma shock of the death of Old Earth had meant acentury of denial, almost as if Earth had never existed, followed by aperiod of revived interest culminating in the Old Earth nostalgia cultswhich could now be found on every world in the Web. A book - even abook of verse - dealing with the final days had struck at precisely theright moment.For me, the first few months of life as a celebrity in the Hegemony werefar more disorienting than my earlier transition from spoiled son of OldEarth to enslaved stroke victim on Heaven's Gate. During those firstmonths I did book and fax signing on more than a hundred worlds; Iappeared on 'The AllNet Now!" show with Marmon Hamlit; I met CEOSenister Per6t and All Thing Speaker Drury Fein aswell as a score ofsenators; I spoke to the Interplanetary Society of PEN Women and to theLusus Writers' Union; I was given honorary degrees at the University ofNew Earth and at Cambridge Two; I was feted, interviewed, imaged,reviewed (favorably), bioed (unauthorized), lionized, serialized, andswindled. It was a busy time.Notes for a sketch of life in the Hegemony:My home has thirty-eight rooms on thirty-six worlds.No doors: the arched entrances are farcaster portals, a few opaqued withprivacy curtains, most open to observation and entry. Each room haswindows everywhere and at least two walls with portals. From the granddining hall on Renaissance Vector, 1 can see the bronze skies and theverdigris towers of Keep Enable in the valley below my volcanic peak,and by turning my head I can look through the farcaster portal andacross the expense of white carpet in the formal living area to seethe Edgar Allan Sea crash against the spires of Point Prospero onNevermore. My library looks out on the glaciers and green skies ofNordholm while a walk of ten paces allows me to descend a short stairwayto my tower study, a comfortable, open room encircled by polarized glasswhich offers a three-hundred-sixty-degree view of the highest peaks ofthe Kushpat Karakoram, a mountain range two thousand kilometers from thenearest settlement in the easternmost reaches of the Jamnu Republic onDeneb Drei.The huge sleeping room Helenda and I share rocks gently in the boughs ofa three-hundred-meter Worldtree on the Templar world of God's Grove andconnects to a solarium which sits alone on the arid saltflats of Hebron.Not all of our views are of wilderness: the media room opens to askimmer pad on the hundred and thirty-eighth floor of a Tau Ceti Centerarctower and our patio lies on a terrace overlooking the market in theOld Section of bustling New Jerusalem. The architect, a student of thelegendary Millon DeHaVre, has incorporated several small jokes into thehouse's design: the steps go down to the tower room, of course, butequally droll is the exit from the eyrie which leads to the exerciseroom on the lowest level of Lusus's deepest Hive, or perhaps the guestbathroom which consists of toilet, bidet, sink and shower stall on anopen, wall-less raft afloat on the violet seaworld of Mare Infinitus.At qst the shifts in gravity from room to room were disturbing, out Isoon adapted, subconsciously bracing myself for the drag of Lusus andHebron and Sol Draconi Septera, unconsciously anticipating the less thanl-stanclra-g freedom of the majority of the rooms.In the te ,,t nclard months Helenda and I are together we spend little6--. in our home, preferring instead to move with frcids ,,nong theresorts and vacation arcologies and night spots of the Worldweb. Our'friends' are the former farcaster set, now calling themselves theCaribou Herd after an extinct, Old Earth migratory mammal. This herdconsists of other writers, a few successful visual artists, Concourseintellectuals, All Thing media representatives, a few radical ARNistsand cosmetic gene splicers, Web aristocrats, wealthy farcaster freaksand Flashback addicts, a few holie and stage directors, a scattering ofactors and performance artists, several Mafia dons gone straight, and arevolving list of recent celebrities... myself included.Everyone drinks, uses stims and autoimplants, takes the wire, and canafford the best drugs. The drug of choice is Flashback. It isdefinitely an upper-class vice: one needs the full range of expensiveimplants to fully experience it.Helenda has seen to it that I have been so fitted: biomonitors, sensoryextenders, and internal comlog, neural shunts, kickers, metacortexprocessors, blood chips, RNA tapeworms . . . my mother wouldn't haverecognized my insides.I try Flashback twice. The first time is a glide - I target my ninthbirthday party and hit it with the first salvo. It is all there: theservants singing on the north lawn at daybreak, don Balthazar grudginglycanceling classes so I can spend the day with Amalfi in my EMV,streaking across the gray dunes of the Amazon Basin in gay abandon; thetorchlight procession that evening as representatives of the other OldFamilies arrive at dusk, their brightly wrapped presents gleaming underthe moon and the Ten Thousand Lights. I rise from nine hours inFlashback with a smile on my face. The second trip almost kills me.I am four and crying, seeking my mother through endless rooms smellingof dust and old furniture. Android servants seek to console me but Ishake off their hands, running down hallways soiled with shadows and thesoot of too many generations. Breaking the first rule I ever learned, Ithrow open the doors to Mother's sewing room, her sanctum sanctorum-towhich she retires for three hours every afternoon and from which sheemerges with her soft smile, the hem of her pale dress whispering acrossthe carpet like the echo of a ghost's sigh.Mother is sitting there in the shadows. ! am four and my finger hasbeen hurt and I rush to her, throwing myself into her arms.She does not respond. One of her elegant arms remains reclined alongthe back of the chaise !ongue, the other remains limp on the cushion.I pull back, shocked by her cool plasticity. I tug open the heavyvelvet drapes without rising from her lap.Mother's eyes are white, rolled back in her head. Her lips are slightlyopen. Drool moistens the corners of her mouth and glints on her perfectchin. From the gold threads of her hair - done up in the Grande Damestyle she favors - I see the cold steel gleam of the stim wire and theduller sheen of the skull socket she has plugged it into. The patch ofbone on either side is very white. On the table near her left hand liesthe empty Flashback syringe.The servants arrive and pull me away. Mother never blinks. I am pulledscreaming from the room.I wake screaming.Perhaps it was my refusal to use Flashback again which hastenedHelenda's departure, but I doubt it. I was a toy to her - a primitivewho amused her by my innocence about a life she had taken for grantedfor many decades.Whatever the case, my refusal to Flashback left me with many dayswithout her; the time spent in replay is real time and Flashback usersoften die having spent more days of their lives under the drug than theyever experienced conscious.At first I entertained myself with the implants and technotoys which hadbeen denied to me as a member of an Old Earth Family. The dataspherewas a constant delight that first year - I called up information almostcontinually, living in a frenzy of full interface. I was as addicted toraw data as the Caribou Herd were to their stims and drugs. I couldimagine don Balthazar spinning in his molten grave as I gave uplong-term memory for the transient satisfaction of implant omniscience.It was only later that I felt the loss- Fitzgerald's Odyssey, Wu'sFinalMarch, and a score of other epics which had survived my stroke nowwere shredded like cloud fragments in a high wind. Much later, freed ofimplants, I painstakingly learned them all again.For the first and only time in my life 1 became political.Days and nights would pass with me monitoring the Senate on farcastercable or lying tapped into the All Thing. Someone once estimated thatthe All Thing deals with about a hundred active pieces of Hegemonylegislation per day, and during my months spent screwed into thesensorium I missed none of them. My voice and name became well known onthe debate channels. No bill was too small, no issue too simple or toocomplex for my input. The simple act of voting every few minutes gaveme a false sense of having accomplished something. I finally gave upthe political obsession only after I realized that accessing the AllThing regularly meant either staying home or turning into a walkingzombie. A person constantly busy accessing on his implants makes apitiful sight in public and it didn't take Helenda's derision to make merealize that if I stayed home I would turn into an All Thing sponge likeso many millions of other slugs around the Web. So I gave up politics.But by then I had found a new passion: religion.I joined religions. Hell, I helped create religions. The Zen GnosticChurch was expanding exponentially and I became a true believer,appearing on HTV talk shows and searching for my Places of Power withall of the devoutness of a pre-Hegira Muslim pilgrimaging to Mecca.Besides, I loved farcasting. I had earned almost a hundred millionmarks from royalties for The Dying Earth, and Helenda had invested well,but someone once figured that a farcaster home such as mine cost morethan fifty thousand marks a day just to keep in the Web and I did notlimit my farcasting to the thirty-six worlds of my home. TranslinePublishing had qualified me for a gold universal card and I used itliberally, farcasting to unlikely corners of the Web and then spendingweeks staying in luxury accommodations and leasing EMVs to find myPlaces of Power in remote areas of backwater worlds.I found none. I renounced Zen Gnosticism about the same time Helendadivorced me. By that time the bills were piling up and I had toliquidate most of the stocks and long-term investments remaining to meafter Helenda had taken her share. (1 was not only naive and in lovewhen she had had her attorneys draw up the marriage contract... I wasstupid.)Eventually, even with such economies as cutting down my farcasting anddismissing the android servants, I was facing financial disaster.I went to see Tyrena Wingreen-Feif.'No one wants to read poetry,' she said, leafing through the thin stackof Cantos I had written in the past year and a half.'What do you mean?" I said. 'The Dying Earth was poetry:''The Dying Earth was a fluke,' said Tyrena. Her nails were long andgreen and curved in the latest mandarin fashion; they curled around mymanuscript like the claws of some chlorophyll beast. 'It sold becausethe mass subconscious was ready for it."'Maybe the mass subconscious is ready for this,' 1 said. I wasbeginning to get angry.Tyrena laughed. It was not an altogether pleasant sound. 'Martin,Martin, Martin,' she said. 'This is poetry. You're writing aboutHeaven's Gate and the Caribou Herd, but what comes across is loneliness,displacement, angst, and a cynical look at humanity." 'So?"'So no one wants topay for a look at another person's angst,' laughedTyrena.I turned away from her desk and walked to the far side of the room. Heroffice took up the entire four hundred and thirty-fifth floor of theTransline Spire in the Babel section of Tau Ceti Center. There were nowindows; the circular room was open from floor to ceiling, shielded by asolar-generated containment field which showed no shimmer whatsoever. Itwas like standing between two gray plates suspended halfway between thesky and earth. I watched crimson clouds move between the lesser spireshalf a kilometer below and I thought about hubris.Tyrena's office had no doorways, stairways, elevators, field lifts, ortrapdoors: no connection to the other levels at all. One enteredTyrena's office through the five-faceted farcaster which shimmered inmidair like an abstract hoiosculpture. I found myself thinking abouttower fires and power failures as well as hubris. I said,'Are you saying that you won't publish it?"'Not at all,' smiled my editor. 'You've earned Transline severalbillion marks, Martin. We will publish it. All I am saying is that noone will buy it."'You're wrong!" I shouted. 'Not everyone recognizes fine poetry, butthere are still enough people who read to make it a bestseller."Tyrena did not laugh again but her smile slashed upward in a twist ofgreen lips. 'Martin, Martin, Martin,' she said, 'the population ofliterate people has been declining steadily since Gutenberg's day. Bythe twentieth century, less than two percent of the people in theso-called industrialized democracies read even one book a year. Andthat was before the smart machines, dataspheres, and user-friendlyenvironments. By the Hegira, ninety-eight percent of the Hegemony'spopulation had no reason to read anything. So they didn't botherlearning how to. It's worse t$day. There are more than a hundredbillion human beings in the Worldweb and less than one percent of thembothers to hardfax any printed material, much less read a book."'The Dying Earth sold almost three billion copies,' I reminded her.'Mm-hmm,' said Tyrena. 'It was the Pilgrim's Progress Effect."'The what?"'Pilgrim's Progress Effect. In the Massachusetts Colony of... what wasit! - seventeenth-century Old Earth, every decent family had to have acopy in the household. But, my heavens, no one had to read it. It wasthe same with Hitler's Mein Kampfor Stukatsky'sVisions in the Eye of a Decapitated Child."'Who was Hitler?" I said.Tyrena smiled slightly. 'An Old Earth politician who did some writing.Mein Kampf is still in print ...Transline renews the copyright every hundred and thirty-eight years."'Well, look,' I said, 'I'm going to take a few weeks to polish up theCantos and give it my best shot."'Fine,' smiled Tyrena.'1 suppose you'll want to edit it the way you did last time?"'Not at all,' said Tyrena. 'Since there's no core of nostalgia thistime, you might as well write it the way you want."I blinked. 'You mean I can keep in the blank verse this time?"'Of course."'And the philosophy?"'Please do."'And the experimental sections?"'Yes."'And you'll print it the way I write it?"'Absolutely."'Is there a chance it'll sell?"'Not a hope in hell."My 'few weeks to polish up the Cantos' turned into ten months ofobsessive labor. I shut off most of the rooms in the house, keepingonly the tower room on Deneb Drei, the exercise room on Lusus, thekitchen, and the bathroom raft on Mare lnfinitus. I worked a straightten hours a day, took a break for some vigorous exercise followed by ameal and a nap, and then returned to my writing table for anothereight-hour stint. It was similar to the time five years before when Iwas recovering from my stroke and it sometimes took an hour or a day fora word to come to me, for a concept to sink its roots into the firm soilof language. Now it was an even slower process as I agonized over theperfect word, the precise rhyme scheme, the most playful image, and themost ineffable analog to the most elusive emotion.After ten standard months I was done, acknowledging the ancient aphorismto the effect that no book or poem is ever finished, merely abandoned.'What do you think?" I asked Tyrena as she read through the first copy.Her eyes were blank, bronze disks in that week's fashion, but this didnot hide the fact that there were tears there. She brushed one away.'It's beautiful,' she said.'I tried to discover the voice of some of the Ancients,' 1 said,suddenly shy.'You succeeded brilliantly."'The Heaven's Gate Interlude is still rough,' I said.'It's perfect."'It's about loneliness,' I said.'It is loneliness."'Do you think it's ready?" I asked.'It's perfect... a masterpiece." 'Do you think it'll sell?" I asked.'No fucking way."They planned an initial run of seventy million hardfax copies of Cantos.Transline ran ads throughout the datasphere, placed HTV commercials,transmitted software inserts, successfully solicited blurbs frombest-selling authors, made sure it was reviewed in the New New YorkTimes Book Section and the TC Review, and generally spent a fortune onadvertising.The Cantos sold twenty-three thousand hardfax copies during the firstyear it was in print. At ten percent royalties of the 12MK cover price,I had earned back 13,800MK of my 2,000,000MK advance from Transline.The second year saw a sale of 638 hardfax copies; there were nodatasphere rights sold, no holie options, and no book tours.What the Cantos lacked in sales it made up for in negative reviews:'Indecipherable... archaic... irrelevant to all current concerns,'said the Times Book Section. 'M. Silenus has committed the ultimateact of non-communication,' wrote Urban Kapry in the TC'v Review, 'byindulging himself in an orgy of pretentious obfuscation." Marmon Hamliton 'AllNet Now!" issued the final deathblow: 'Oh, the poetry thing fromWhatshisname - couldn't read it. Didn't try."Tyrena Wingreen-Fef did not seem concerned. Two weeks after the firstreviews and hardfax returns came in, a day after my thirteen-day bingeended, I farcast to her office and threw myself into the black flowfoamchair which crouched in the center of the room like a velvetpanther. One of Tau Ceti Center's legendary thunderstorms was going onand Jovian-sized lightning crashes were rending the blood-tinged airjust beyond the invisible containment field.'Don't sweat it,' said Tyrena. This week's fashions included a hairdowhich sent black spikes thrusting half a meter above her forehead and abody field opaciter which left shifting currents of color concealing -and revealing- the nudity beneath. 'The first run only amounted tosixty thousand fax transmits so we're not out much there."'You said seventy million were planned,' I said.'Yeah, well, we changed our minds after Transline's resident AI readit."I slumped lower in the flowfoam. 'Even the AI hated it?"'The AI loved it,' said Tyrena. 'That's when we knew for sure thatpeople were going to hate it."I sat up. 'Couldn't we have sold copies to the TechnoCore?"'We did,' said Tyrena. 'One. The millions of Als there probablyreal-time-shared it the minute it came in over fatline. Interstellarcopyright doesn't mean shit when you're dealing with silicon."'All right,' I said, slumping. 'What next?" Outside, lightning boltsthe size of Old Earth's ancient super-highways danced between thecorporate spires and cloud towers.Tyrena rose from her desk and walked to the edge of the carpeted circle.Her body field flickered like electrically charged oil on water. 'Next,'she said, 'you decide if you want to be a writer or the Worldweb'sbiggest jerk-off."'What?"'You heard me." Tyrena turned and smiled. Her teeth had been capped togold points. 'The contract allows us to recover the advance in any waywe have to. Seizing your assets at Interbank, recovering the gold coinsyou've got hidden on Homefree, and selling that gaudy farcaster housewould about do it. And then you can go join the other artisticdilettantes and dropouts andmental cases that Sad King Billy collects on whateverOutback world he lives on."I stared.'Then again,' she said and smiled her cannibal smile, 'we can justforget this temporary setback and you can get to work on your nextbook."My next book appeared five standard months later. The Dying Earth Hpicked up where The Dying Earth left off, in plain prose this time, thesentence length and chapter content carefully guided byneuro-bio-monitored responses on a test group of 638 average hard faxreaders.The book was in novel form, short enough not to intimidate the potentialbuyer at Food Mart checkout stands, and the cover was a twenty-secondinteractive holo wherein the tall, swarthy stranger - Amalfi Schwartz, Isuppose, although Amalfi was short and pale and wore corrective lenses-rips the bodice of the struggling female just to the nipple line beforethe protesting blonde turns toward the viewer and cries for help in abreathlesswhisper provided by porn holie star Leeda Swann.Dying Earth H sold nineteen million copies.'Not bad,' said Tyrena. 'It takes awhile to build an audience."'The first Dying Earth sold three billion copies,' I said.'Pilgrim's Progress,' she said. 'Mein Kampf. Once in a century. Maybeless."'But it sold three billion..."'Look,' said Tyrena. 'In twentieth-century Old Earth, a fast food chaintook dead cow meat, fried it in grease, added carcinogens, wrapped it inpetroleum-based foam, and sold nine hundred billion units. Humanbeings. Go figure."Dying Earth III introduced the characters of Winona, the escaped slavegirl who rose to the ownership of her own fiberplastic plantation (nevermind that fiberplastic never grew on Old Earth), Arturo Redgrave, thedashing blockade runner (what blockade?!), and Innocence Sperry, thenine-year-old telepath dying of an unspecified Little Nell disease.Innocence lasted untilDying Earth IX, and on the day Transline allowed mc to kill the littleshit off, I went out to celebrate with a six-day, ',wenty-world binge. Iawoke in a lungpipe on Hcaven's Gate, covered with vomit and rebreatbermold, nursing the Wcb's biggest beadache and the sure knowledge that Isoon would have to start on Volume X of The Chronicles of the DyingEarth.It isn't hard being a hack writer. Between Dying Earth H and DyingEarth IX, six standard years had passed relatively painlessly. Myresearch was meager, my plots for-mulaic, my characters cardboard, myprose preliterate, and my free time was my own. I traveled. I marriedtwice more; each wife left me with no hard feelings but with a sizableportion of the royalties from my next Dying Earth. I explored religionsand serious drinking, finding more hope of lasting solace in the latter.I kept my home, adding six rooms on five worlds, and filled it with fineart. I entertained. Writers were among my acquaintances but, as in alltimes, we tended to mistrust and badmouth each other, secretly resentingthe other's successes and finding fault in their work. Each of us knewin his or her heart that he or she was a true artist of the word whomerely happened to be commercial; the others were hacks.Then, on a cool morning with my sleeping room rocking slightly in theupper branches of my tree on the Templar world, I awoke to a gray skyand the realization that my muse had fled.It had been five years since I had written any poetry.The Cantos lay open in the Deneb Drei tower, only a few pages finishedbeyond what had been published. I had been using thought processors towrite my novels and one of these activated as I entered the study. SHIT,it printed out, WHAT DID i DO WITH MY MUSE?It says something about the type of writing I had been doing that mymuse could flee without my noticing. For those who do not write and whonever have been stirred by the creative urge, talk of muses seems afigure of speech, a quaint conceit, but for those of us who live by theWord, our muses are as real and necessary as the softclay of language which they help to sculpt. When one is writing -really writing - it is as if one is given a fatlinc to tbe gods. Notrue poet has been able to explain the exhilaration one feels when themind becomes an instrument as surely as does the pen or thoughtprocessor, ordering and expressing the revelations flowing in fromsomewhere else.My muse had fled. I sought her in the other worlds of my house but onlysilence echoed back from the art-bedecked walls and empty spaces. Ifarcast and flew to my favorite places, watching the suns set on thewindblown prairies of Grass and the night fogs obscure the ebony cragsof Nevermore, but although I emptied my mind of tbe trash-prose of theendless Dying Earth, there came no whispers from my muse.I sought her in alcohol and Flashback, returning to the productive dayson Hcaven's Gate when her inspiration was a constant buzzing in my cars,interrupting my work, waking mc from sleep, but in the rclived hours anddays her voice was as muted and garbled as a damaged audio disk fromsome forgotten century.My muse had fled.I farcast to Tyrena Wingreen-Feif's office at the precise moment of myappointment. Tyrena had been promoted from editor-in-chief of thehardfax division to publisher.Her new office occupied the highest level of the Tau Ceti CenterTransline Spire and standing there was like perching on the carpetedsummit of the galaxy's tallest, thinnest peak; only the invisible domeof the slightly polarized containment field arched overhead and the edgeof the carpet ended in a six-kilometer drop. 1 wondered if otherauthors felt the urge to jump.'The new opus?" said Tyrena. Lusus was dominating the fashion universethis week and 'dominate' was the right word; my editor was dressed inleather and iron, rusted spikes on her wrists and neck and a massiveban-dolier across her shoulder and left breast. The cartridges lookedreal.'Yeah,' I said and tossed the manuscript box on her desk.'Martin, Martin, Martin,' she sighed, 'when are you going to transmityour books rather than going to all the trouble of printing them out andbringing them here in person?"'There's a strange satisfaction in delivering them,' Isaid. 'Especially this one."'Oh?"'Yes,' I said. 'Why don't you read some of it?" Tyrena smiled andclicked black fingernails along the cartridges in her bandolicr. 'I'msure it's up to your usual high standards, Martin,' she said. 'I don'thave to look at it."'Please do,' I said.'Really,' said Tyrcna, 'there's no reason. It always makes me nervousto read a new work while the author is present." 'This one won't,' I said. 'Read just the first few pages."She must have heard something in my voice because she frowned slightlyand opened the box. The frown deepened as she read the first page andflipped through the rest of the manuscript.Page one had a single sentence: 'And then, one fine morning in October,the Dying Earth swallowed its own bowels, spasmed its final spasm anddied." The other twohundred and ninety-nine pages were blank.'A joke, Martin?".'Nope."'A subtle hint then? You would like to begin a new series?"'Nope."'It's not as if we hadn't expected it, Martin. Our story-liners havecome up with several exciting series ideas for you. M. Subwaizeethinks that you would be perfect for the novelizations of the CrimsonAvenger holies."'You can stick the Crimson Avenger up your corporate ass, Tyrena,' Isaid cordially. 'I'm finished with Transline and this premasticatedgruel you call fiction."Tyrena's expression did not flicker. Her teeth were not pointed; todaythey were rusted iron to match the spikes on her wrists and the collararound her neck. 'Martin,Martin, Martin,' she sighed, 'you have no idea how finished you will beif you don't apologize, straighten up, and fly right. But that can waituntil tomorrow. Why don't you step home, sober up, and think aboutthis?"I laughed. 'I'm as sober as l've been in eight years, lady. It justtook me awhile to realize that it wasn't just me who's writing crap...there's not a book published in the Web this year that hasn't been totalgarbage. Well, l'm getting off the scow."Tyrena rose. For the first time I noticed that on her simulated canvasweb belt there hung a FORCE death-wand.I hoped that it was a designer-fake as the rest of her costume.'Listen, you miserable, no-talent hack,' she hissed.'Transline owns you from the balls up. If you give us any more troublewe'll have you working in the Gothic Romance factory under the nameRosemary Titmouse.Now go home, sober up, and get to work on Dying Earth X."I smiled and shook my head.Tyrena squinted slightly. 'You're still into us for almost amillion-mark advance,' she said. 'One word to Collections and we'llseize every room of your house except that goddamn raft you use as anouthouse. You can sit on it until the oceans fill up with crap."I laughed a final time. 'It's a self-contained disposal unit,' I said.'Besides, I sold the house yesterday. The check for the balance of theadvance should have been transmitted by now."Tyrena tapped the plastic grip of her deathwand.'Transline's copyrighted the Dying Earth concept, youknow. We'll just have someone else write the books."I nodded. 'They're welcome to it."Something in my ex-editor's voice changed when she realized that I wasserious. Somewhere, I sensed, there was an advantage to her if Istayed. 'Listen,' she said, 'l'm sure we can work this out, Martin. Iwas saying to the director the other day that your advances were toosmall and that Transline should let you develop a new story line..."'Tyrena, Tyrena, Tyrena,' I sighed. 'Goodbye."I farcast to Renaissance VectOr and then to Parsimony, where ! boardeda spinship for the three-week voyage to Asquith and the crowded kingdomof Sad King Billy.Notes for a sketch of Sad King Billy:His Royal Highness King William XXIII, sovereign lord of the Kingdom ofWindsor-in-Exile, looks a bit like a wax candle of a man who has beenleft on a hot stove.His long hair runs in limp rivulets to slumped shoulders while thefurrows on his brow trickle downward to the tributaries of wrinklesaround the basset-hound eyes, and then run southward again through foldsand frown lines to the maze of wattles in neck and jowls. King Billy issaid to remind anthropologists of the worry dolls of the OutbackKinshasa, to make Zen Gnostics recall the Pitiful Buddha after thetemple fire on Tai Zhin, and to send media historians rushing to theirarchives to check photos of an ancient flat-film movie actor namedCharles Laughton. None of these references mean anything to me; I lookat King Billy and think of my long-dead tutor don Balthazar after aweek-long binge.Sad King Billy's reputation for gloominess is exaggerated.He often laughs; it is merely his misfortune that his peculiar form oflaughter makes most people think he is sobbing.A man cannot help his physiognomy, but in His Highness's case, theentire persona tends to suggest either 'buffoon' or 'victim." Hedresses, if that can be the word, in something approaching a constantstate of anarchy, defying the taste and color sense of his androidservants, so that on some days he clashes with himself and hisenvironment simultaneously. Nor is his appearance limited to sartorialchaos - King William moves in a permanent sphere of dishabille, his flyunsealed, his velvet cape torn and tattered and drawing crumbsmagnetically from the floor, his left sleeve ruffle twice as long as theright, which - in turn - looks as if it has been dipped in jam.You get the idea.For all this, Sad King Billy has an insightful mind and a passion forthe arts and literature which has not been equaled since the trueRenaissance days on old Old Earth.In some ways King Billy is the fat child with his face eternally pressedto the candy store window. He loves and appreciates fine music butcannot produce it. A connoisseur of ballet and all things graceful, HisHighness is a klutz, a moving series of pratfalls and comic bits ofclumsiness. A passionate reader, unerring poetry critic, and patron offorensics, King Billy combines a stutter in his verbal expression with ashyness which will not allow him to show his verse or prose to anyoneelse.A lifelong bachelor now entering his sixtieth year, King Billy inhabitsthe tumbledown palace and two-thousand-square-mile kingdom as if it wereanother suit of rumpled, royal clothes. Anecdotes abound: one of thefamous oil painters whom King Billy supports finds His Majesty walkinghead down, hands clasped behind him, one foot on the garden path and onein the mud, obviously lost in thought. The artist hails his patron. SadKing Billy looks up, blinks, looks around as if awakening from a longnap. 'Excuse me,' His Highness says to the bemused painter, 'b-b-butcould you p-p-please tell me - was I headed toward the palace or awayfrom the p-p-palace?" 'Toward the palace, Your Majesty,' replies theartist. 'Oh, g-g-good,' sighs the King, 'then l've had lunch."General Horace Glennon-Height had begun his rebellion and the Outbackworld of Asquith lay directly in his path of conquest. Asquith was not- the Hegemony had offered a FORCE:space fleet as a shield - butthe royal ruler of the Kingdom of Monaco-in-Exile seemed more meltedthan ever when he called me in.'Martin,' said His Majesty, 'you've h-h-heard about the b-battle forFomalhaut?"'Yeah,' I said. 'It doesn't sound like anything to worry about.Fomalhaut was just the kind of place Glennon-Height's been hitting ...small, no more than a few thousand colonists, rich in minerals, and witha time-debt of at least - what was it? - twenty standard months fromthe Web."'Twenty-three,' said Sad King Billy. 'So you d-d-don't think that w-weare in d-d-d-jeopardy?"'Uh-uh,' I said. 'With only a three-week real-transit time and atime-debt of less than a year, the Hegemony can always get forces herefrom the Web faster than the General can spin up from Fomalhaut."'Perhaps,' mused King Billy, beginning to lean on a globe and thenjumping upright as it started to turn under his weight. 'Butnone-the-the less I've decided to start our own m-m-modest Hegira."I blinked, surprised. Billy had been talking about relocating thekingdom in exile for almost two years, but I had never thought he wouldgo through with it.'The sp-sp-sp... the ships are ready on Parvati,' he said. 'Asquithhas agreed to su-su-su... to provide the transport we need to the Web."'But the palace?" I said. 'The library? The farms and grounds?"'Donated, of course,' said King Billy, 'but the contents of the librarywill travel with us."I sat on the arm of the horsehair divan and rubbed my cheek. In the tenyears I had been in the kingdom, I had progressed from Billy's subjectof patronage to tutor, to confidant, to friend, but never did I pretendto understand this disheveled enigma. Upon my arrival he had granted mean immediate audience. 'D-d-do you w-w-wish to j-j-join the othert-t-talented people in our little colony?" he had asked.'Yes, Your Majesty."'And w-w-will you wr-wr-write more books like the D-D-Dying Earth?"'Not if I can help it, Your Majesty."'i r-r-read it, you know,' the little man had said. 'It was v-v-veryinteresting."'You're most kind, Sir."'B-b-b-bullshit, M. Silenus. It w-w-was interesting because someonehad obviously b-b-bowdlerized it and left in all the bad parts."I had grinned, surprised by the sudden revelation that I was going tolike Sad King Billy.'B-b-but the Cantos,' he sighed, 'th-th-that was abook. Probably the finest volume of v-v... poetry published in the Webin the last two centuries. How you managed to get that by themediocrity police I will never know. I ordered twenty thousand copiesfor the k-k-kingdom."I bowed my head slightly, at a loss for words for thefirst time since my poststroke days two decades before.'Will you write more p-p-poetry like the Cantos?" 'I came here to try,Your Majesty."'Then welcome,' said Sad King Billy. 'You will stay in the west wing ofthe p-p-p... castle, near my offices, and my door will always be opento you."Now I glanced at the closed door and at the little sovereign who - evenwhen smiling - looked as if he were on the verge of tears. 'Hyperion?"I asked. He had mentioned the colony world-gone-primitive many times. ,'Precisely. The android seedships have been there for some years,M-M-Martin. Preparing the way, as it were."I raised an eyebrow. King Billy's wealth came not from the assets ofthe kingdom but from major investments in the Web economy. Even so, ifhe had been carrying on a surreptitious recolonization effort for years,the cost must have been staggering.'D-d-do you remember why the original colonists named the pluh-pluh-pluh... the world Hyperion, Martin?"'Sure. Before the Hegira they were a tiny freehold on one of the moonsof Saturn. They couldn't last without terrestrial resupply, so theyemigrated to the Outback and named the survey world after their moon."King Billy smiled sadly. 'And do you Inow why the name isp-p-propitious for our endeavor?"It took me about ten seconds to make the connection.'Keats,' I said.Several years earlier, near the end of a long discussion about theessence of poetry, King Billy had asked me who was the purest poet whohad ever lived.'The purest?" I had said. 'Don't you mean the greatest ?"'No, no,' said Billy, 'that's absurd t-t-to argue over who is thegreatest. i'm curious about your opinion ofthe p-p-purest... the closest to the essence you describe."I had thought about it a few days and then brought my answer to KingBilly as we watched the setting suns from the top of the bluff near thepalace. Red and blue shadows stretched across the amber lawn toward us.'Keats,' I said.'John Keats,' whispered Sad King Billy. 'Ahh." And then a moment later:'Why?"So I had told him what I knew about the nineteenth-century Old Earthpoet; about his upbringing, training, and early death ... but mostlyabout a life dedicated almost totally to the mysteries and beauties ofpoetic creation.Billy had seemed interested then; he seemed obsessed now as he waved hishand and brought into existence a holo model which all but filled theroom. I moved backward, stepping through hills and buildings andgrazing animals to get a better view.'Behold Hyperion,' whispered my patron. As was usually the case when hewas totally absorbed, King Billy forgot to stutter. The holo shiftedthrough a series of views: river cities, port cities, mountain eyries, acity on a hill filled with monuments to match the strange buildings in anearby valley.'The Time Tombs?" I said.'Precisely. The greatest mystery in the known universe."I frowned at the hyperbole. 'They're fucking empty,' I said. 'They'vebeen empty since they were discovered."'They are the source of a strange, anti-entropic force-field whichlingers still,' said King Billy. 'One of the few phenomena outsidesingularities which dares to tamper with time itself."'It's no big deal,' I said. 'It must've been like painting rustpreventative on metal. They were made to last but they're empty. Andsince when do we go bugfuck about technology?"'Not technology,' sighed King Billy, his face melting into deepergrooves. 'Mystery. The strangeness of place so necessary to somecreative spirits. A perfect mixture of the classical utopia and thepagan mystery."I shrugged, not impressed.Sad King Billy waved the hoio away. 'Has your p-p-poetry improved?"I crossed my arms and glared at the regal dwarf-slob.'No."'Has your m-m-muse returned?"I said nothing. If looks could have killed, we would all be crying 'TheKing is dead, long live the King!" before nightfall.'Very w-w-we!i,' he said, showing that he could look insufferably smugas well as sad. 'P-p-pack your bags, my boy. We're going to Hyperion."(Fade in)Sad King Billy's five seedships floating like golden dandelions above alapis sky. White cities rising on three continents: Keats, Endymion,Port Romance ... the Poets' City itself. More than eight thousand ofArt's pilgrims seeking escape from the tyranny of mediocrity andsearching for a renewal of vision on this rough-hewn world.Asquith and Windsor-in-Exile had been a center for android biofacture inthe century following the Hegira, and now these blueskinnedfriends-of-man labored and tilled with the understanding that once thesefinal labors were finished they were free at last. The white citiesrose.The indigenies, tired of playing native, came out' of their villages andforests and helped us rebuild the colony to more human specifications.The technocats and bureaucrats and ecocrats were thawed and let looseupon the unsuspecting world and Sad King Billy's dream came one stepcloser to reality.By the time we arrived at Hyperion, General Horace Glennon-Height wasdead, his brief but brutal mutiny already crushed, but there was noturning back.Some of the more rugged artists and artisans spurned the Poets' City andeked out rugged but creative lives in Jacktown or Port Romance, or evenin the expanding frontiers beyond, but I stayed.I found no muse on Hyperion during those first years.For many, the expansion of distance because of limited transportation -EMVs were unreliable, skimmersscarce - and the contraction of artificial consciousness due to absenceof datasphere, no access to the All Thing, and only one fatlinetransmitter - all led to a renewal of creative energies, a newrealization of what it meant to behuman and an artist.Or so I heard.No muse appeared. My verse continued to be techni cally proficient anddead as Huck Finn's cat.I decided to kill myself.But first I spent some time, nine years at least, carrying out acommunity service by providing the one thing new Hyperion lacked:decadence.From a biosculptor aptly named Graumann Hacket, I obtained the hairyflanks, hooves, .and goat legs of a satyr. I cultivated my beard andextended my ears.Graumann made interesting alterations to my sexual apparatus. Word gotaround. Peasant girls, indigenies, the wives of our true-blue cityplanners and pioneers -all awaited a visit from Hyperion's only residentsatyr or arranged one themselves. I learned what 'priapic' and'satyriasis' really mean. Besides the unending series of sexualcontests, I allowed my drinking bouts to become legendary and myvocabulary to return to something approaching the old poststroke daysIt was fucking wonderful. It was fucking hell.And then on the night I had set aside to blow my brains out, Grendelappeared.Notes for a sketch of our visiting monster:Our worst dreams have come alive. Something wicked shuns the light.Shades of Morbius and the Kre!l. Keep the fires high, Mother, Grendelcomes tonight.At first we think the missing are merely absent; there are no watcherson the wails of our city, no walls actually, no warriors at the door ofour mead hall. Then a husband reports a wife who disappears between theeve ning meal and the tucking in of their two children. Then HobanKristus, the abstract impiosionist, fails to appear at midweekperformance at Poets' Amphitheatre, his first missed cue in eighty-twoyears of treading the boards. Concern rises. Sad King Billy returnsfrom his labors as overseer on the .lacktown restoration and promisesthat security will be tightened. A sensor net is woven around the town.ShipSecurity officers sweep the Time Tombs and report that all remainsempty. Mechs are sent into the labyrinth entrance at the base of theJade Tomb and report nothing in a six-thousand-kilometer probe.Skimmers, automated and manned, sweep the area between the city and theBridle Range and sense nothing larger than the heat signature of a rockeel.For a local week there are no more disappearances.Then the deaths begin.The sculptor Pete Garcia is found in his studio . . .and in his bedroom... and in the yard beyond. Ship-Security ManagerTruin Hines is foolish enough to tell a newsteep: 'It's like he wasmauled by some vicious animal.But no animal I've ever seen could do that to a man."We are all secretly thrilled and titillated. True, the dialogue is bad,straight out of a million movies and holies we've scared ourselves with,but now we are part of the show.Suspicion turns toward the obvious: a psychopath is loose among us,probably killing with a pulse-blade or hellwhip. This time he (or she)had not found time to dispose of the body. Poor Pete.ShipSecurity Manager Hines is sacked and City Manager Pruett receivespermission from His Majesty to hire, train, and arm a city police forceof approximately twenty officers. There is talk of truth-testing theentire Poets' City population of six thousand. Sidewalk cafes buzz withconversation on civil rights... we were technically out of the Hegemony- did we have any rights?. . and harebrained schemes are hatched to catch the murderer.Then the slaughter begins.There was no pattern to the murders. Bodies were found in twos andthrees, or alone, or not at all. Some of the disappearances werebloodless; others left gallons of gore. There were no witnesses, nosurvivors of attacks.Location did not seem to matter: the Weimont familylived in one of the outlying villas but Sira Rob never stirred from hertower studio near the center of town; two of the victims disappearedalone, at night, apparently while walking in the Zen Garden, butChancellor Lehman's daughter had private bodyguards yet vanished whilealone in a bathroom on the seventh floor of Sad King Billy's palace.On Lusus or Tau Ceti Center or a dozen other of the old Web worlds, thedeaths of a thousand people add up to minor news - items for datasphereshort-term or the inside pages of the morning paper - but in a city ofsix thousand on a colony of fifty thousand, a dozen murders - like theproverbial sentence to be hanged in the morning- tend to focus one'sattention wonderfully well.I knew one of the first victims. Sissipriss Harris had been one of myfirst conquests as a satyr - and one of my most enthusiastic - abeautiful girl, long blond hair too soft to be real, afresh-picked-peach complexion too virginal to dream of touching, abeauty too perfect to believe: precisely the sort that even the mosttimid male dreams of violating, Sissipriss now had been violated inearnest. They found only her head, lying upright in the center of LordByron's Plaza as if she had been buried to her neck in pourable marble.I knew when I heard these details precisely what kind of creature wewere dealing with, for a cat I had owned on Mother's estate had leftsimilar offerings on the south patio most summer mornings - the head ofa mouse staring up from the sandstone in pure rodent amazement, orperhaps a ground squirrel's toothy grin- killing trophies from a proudbut hungry predator.Sad King Billy came to visit me while I was working on my Cantos.'Good morning, Billy,' I said.'It's Your Majesty,' grumped His Majesty in a rare show of royal pique.His stutter had disappeared the day the royal dropship landed onHyperion.'Good morning, Billy, Your Majesty."'Hnnrh,' growled my liege lord, moving some papersand managing to sit in the only puddle of spilled coffee on an otherwisedry bench. 'You're writing again, Silenus."I saw no reason to acknowledge an acknowledgment of the obvious.'Have you always used a pen7''No,' I said, 'only when I want to write something worth reading."'Is that worth reading?" He gestured toward the small heap of manuscriptI had accrued in two local weeks of work.'Yes."'Yes? Just yes?"'Yes."'Will I get to read it soon?"'No."King Billy looked down and noticed that his leg was in a puddle ofcoffee. He frowned, moved, and mopped at the shrinking pool with thehem of his cape. 'Never?" he said.'Not unless you outlive me."'Which I plan to do,' said the King. 'While you expirefrom playing goat to the kingdom's ewes."'Is that an attempt at a metaphor?"'Not in the least,' said King Billy. 'Merely an observation. ''I haven't forced my attentions on a ewe since my boyhood days on thefarm,' I said. 'I promised my mother in song that I wouldn't indulge insheep fucking again without asking her permission." While King Billylooked on mournfully, I sang a few bars of an ancient ditty called'There'll Never Be Another Ewe."'Martin,' he said, 'someone or something is killing my people."I set aside my paper and pen. '1 know,' I said.'I need your help."'How, for Christ's sake? Am I supposed to track down the killer likesome HTV detective? Have a fight to the fucking death on Reichenbachfucking Falls?"'That would be satisfactory, Martin. But in the meantime a few opinionsand words of advice would suffice."'Opinion One,' I said, 'it was stupid to come here.Opinion Two, it's stupid to stay. Advice Alpha/Omega: leave."King Billy nodded dolefully. 'Leave this city or all of Hyperion?"I shrugged.His Majesty rose and walked to the window of my small study. It lookedout across a three-meter alley to the brick wall of the automatedrecycling plant next door. King Billy studied the view. 'You'reaware,' hesaid, 'of the ancient legend of the Shrike?"'I've heard bits of it."'The indigenies associate the monster with the Time Tombs,' he said.'The indigenies smear paint on their bellies for the harvest celebrationand smoke unrecombinant tobacco,' I said.King Billy nodded at the wisdom of this. He said: 'The HegemonyFirstdown Team was wary of this area. They set up the multichannelrecorders and kept their bases south of the Bridle."'Look,' I said, 'Your Majesty... what do you want?Absolution for screwing up and building the city here?You're absolved. Go and sin no more, my son. Now, if you don't mind,Your Royalship, adi6s. l've got dirty limericks to write here."King Billy did not turn away from the window. 'Yourecommend that we evacuate the city, Martin?" I hesitated only a second.'Sure." 'And would you leave with the rest?" 'Why wouldn't I?"King Billy turned and looked me in the eye. 'Would you?"I said nothing. After a minute I looked away.'I thought so,' said the ruler of the planet. He clasped his pudgyhands behind his back and stared at the wall again. 'If I were adetective,' he said, 'I would be suspicious.The city's least productive citizen starts writing again after a decadeof silence only... what, Martin? . . two days after the first murders happened. Now he's disappearedfrom the social life he once dominated andspends his time composing an epic poem... why, eventhe young girls are safe from his goatish ardor."i sighed. 'Goatish ardor, m'!ord?"King Billy glanced over his shoulder at me.'All right,' I said. 'You've got me. I confess. I've been murderingthem and bathing in their blood. It works as a fucking literaryaphrodisiac. I figure two... three hundred more victims, tops... andI'll have my next book ready for publication."King Billy turned back to the window.'What's the matter,' I said, 'don't you believe me?" 'No." 'Why not?"'Because,' said the King, 'I know who the murderer is."We sat in the darkened holopit and watched the Shrike kill novelist SiraRob and her lover. The light level was very low; Sira's middle-agedflesh seemed to glow with a pale phosphorescence while her much youngerboyfriend's white buttocks gave the illusion in the dim light offloating separately from the rest of his tanned body.Their lovemaking was reaching its frenzied peak when the inexplicableoccurred. Rather than the final thrusts and sudden pause of orgasm, theyoung man seemed to levitate up and backward, rising into the air as ifSira had somehow forcefully ejected him from her body. The sound trackon the disk, previously consisting of the usual banal pants, gasps,exhortations, and instructions one would expect from such activity,suddenly filled the holopit with screams- first the young man's, thenSira's.There was a thud as the boy's body struck a wall off camera. Sira'sbody lay waiting in tragically comic vulnerability, her legs wide, armsopen, breasts flattened, thighs pale. Her head had been thrown back inecstasy but now she had time to raise it, shock and anger alreadyreplacing the oddly similar expression of imminent orgasm. She openedher mouth to shout something.No words. There came the watermelon-carving sound of blades piercingflesh, of hooks being pulled free oftendon and bone. Sira's head went back, her mouth opened impossiblywide, and her body exploded from the breastbone down. Flesh separated aif an invisible ax were chopping Sira Rob for kindling. Unseen scalpelscompleted the job of opening her, lateral incisions appearing likeobscene time-lapse footage of a mad surgeon's favorite operation. Itwas a brutal autopsy performed on a living person. On a once livingperson, rather, for when the blood stopped flying and the body ceasedspasming, Sira's limbs relaxed in death, legs opening again in an echoof the obscene display of viscera above. And then- for the briefestsecond - there was a blur of red and chrome near the bed.'Freeze, expand, and augment,' King Billy told the house computer.The blur resolved itself into a head out of a jolt addict's nightmare: aface part steel, part chrome, and part skull, teeth like a mechanizedwolf's crossed with a steam shovel, eyes like ruby lasers burningthrough blood-filled gems, forehead penetrated by a curved spike-bladerising thirty centimeters from a quicksilverskull, and a neck ringed with similar thorns.'The Shrike?" I asked.King Billy nodded - the merest movement of chin and jowls.'What happened to the boy?" I asked.'There was no sign of him when Sira's body was discovered,' said theKing. 'No one knew he was missing until this disk was discovered. Hehas been identified as ayoung recreation specialist from Endymion."'You just found the holo?"'Yesterday,' said King Billy. 'The security people found the imager onthe ceiling. Less than a millimeter across. Sira had a library of suchdisks. The cameraapparently was there only to record... ah..." 'The bedroom follies,' Isaid.'Precisely."I stood up and approached the floating image of the creature. My handpassed through forehead, spike, and jaws. The computer had calculatedits size and representedit properly. Judging from the thing's head, our local Grendel stoodmore than three meters tall. 'Shrike,' Imuttered, more in greeting than in identification.'What can you tell me about it, Martin?"'Why ask me?" I snapped. 'I'm a poet, not a mythohistorian."'You accessed the seedship computer with a query about the Shrike'snature and origins."I raised an eyebrow. Computer access was supposed to be as private andanonymous as datasphere entry in the Hegemony. 'So what?" I said.'Hundreds of people must have checked out the Shrike legend since thekillings began. Maybe thousands. It's the only fucking monster legendwe've got."King Billy moved his wrinkles and folds up and down.'Yes,' he said, 'but you searched the files three months before thefirst disappearance."I sighed and slumped into the holopit cushions. 'All right,' I said, 'Idid. So what? I wanted to use the fucking legend in the fucking poemI'm writing, so I researched it.Arrest me."'What did you learn?"I was very angry now. I stamped satyr hooves into the soft carpet.'Just the stuff in the fucking file,' I snapped.'What in the hell do you want from me, Billy?"The King rubbed his brow and winced as he accidentally stuck his littlefinger in his eye. '1 don't know,' he said.'The security people wanted to take you up to the ship and put you onfull interrogative interface. I chose to talk to you instead."I blinked, feeling a strange zero-g sensation in my stomach.Full interrogative meant cortical shunts and sockets in the skull. Mostpeople interrogated that way recovered fully. Most.'Can you tell me what aspect of the Shrike legend you planned to use inyour poem?" King Billy asked softly.'Sure,' I said. 'According to the Shrike Cult gospel that theindigenies started, the Shrike is the Lord of Pain and the Angel ofFinal Atonement, come from a place beyond time to announce the end ofthe human race. I liked that conceit."'The end of the human race,' repeated King Billy.'Yeah. He's Michael the Archangel and Moroni and Satan and MaskedEntropy and the Frankenstein monster all rolled into one package,' Isaid. 'He hangs around the Time Tombs waiting to come out and wreakhavoc when it's mankind's time to join the dodo and the gorilla and thesperm whale on the extinction Hit Parade list."'The Frankenstein monster,' mused the short little fat man in thewrinkled cape. 'Why him?"I took a breath. 'Because the Shrike Cult believes that mankind somehowcreated the thing,' I said, although Iknew that King Billy knew everything I knew and more.'Do they know how to kill it?" he asked.'Not that I know of. He's supposed to be immortal,beyond time."'A god?"I hesitated. 'Not really,' I said at last. 'More like one of theuniverse's worst nightmares come to life. Sort of like the Grim Reaper,but with a penchant for sticking souls on a giant thorn tree... whilethe people's soulsare still in their bodies."King Billy nodded.'Look,' I said, 'if you insist on splitting hairs from back-worldtheologies, why don't you fly to Jacktown and ask a few of the Cultpriests?"'Yes,' said the King, chin on his pudgy fist, obviously distracted,'they're already on the seedship being interrogated.It's all most confusing."I rose to leave, not sure if I would be allowed to.'Martin?" 'Yeah." 'Before you go, can you think of anything else that could help usunderstand this thing?"I paused in the doorway, feeling my heart batting at my ribs to get out.'Yeah,' I said, my voice only marginally steady. '1 can tell you whoand what the Shrikereally is."'Oh?"'It's my muse,' I said, and turned, and went back to my room to write.Of course I had summoned the Shrike. I knew that. I had summoned it bybeginning my epic poem about it. In the beginning was the Word.I retitled my poem The Hyperion Cantos. It was not about the planet butabout the passing of the self-styled Titans called humans. It was aboutthe unthinking hubris of a race which dared to murder its homeworldthrough sheer carelessness and then carried that dangerous arrogance tothe stars, only to meet the wrath of a god which humanity had helped tosire. Hyperion was the first serious work I had done in many years andit was the best I would ever do. What began as a comic-serious homageto the ghost of John Keats became my last reason for existence, an epictour de force in an age of mediocre farce. Hyperion Cantos was writtenwith a skill I could never have attained, with a mastery I could neverhave gained, and sung in a voice which was not mine.The passing of humankind was my topic. The Shrike was my muse.A score more people died before King Billy evacuated the City of Poets.Some of the evacuees went to Endymion or Keats or one of the other newcities, but most voted to take the seedships back to the Web. KingBilly's dream of a creative utopia died, although the King himself livedon in the gloomy palace at Keats.Leadership of the colony passed to the Home Rule Council, whichpetitioned the Hegemony for membership and immediately established aSelf-defense Force.The SDF - made up primarily of the same indigenies who had beencudgelinc each other a decade before, but commanded now by self-styledofficers from our new colony - succeeded only in disturbing thepeacefulness of the night with their automated skimmer patrols andmarring the beauty of the returning desert with their mobilesurveillance mechs.Surprisingly, I was not the only one to stay behind; at least twohundred remained, although most of us avoided social contact, smilingpolitely when we passed on Poets' Walk or while we ate apart in theechoing emptiness of the dining dome.The murders and disappearances continued, averaging about one a localfortnight, although they were usually discovered not by us but by theregional SDF commander, who demanded a head count of citizens every fewweeks.The image that remains in my mind from that first year is an unusuallycommunal one: the night we gathered on the Commons to watch the seedshipleave. It was at the height of the autumn meteor season and Hyperion'snight skies were already ablaze with gold streaks and red crisscrossesof flame when the seedship's engines fired, a small sun flared, and foran hour we watched as friends and fellow artists receded as a streak offusion flame. Sad King Billy joined us that night and I remember thathe looked at me before he solemnly reentered his ornate coach to returnto the safety of Keats.In the dozen years which followed I left the city half a dozen times;once to find a biosculptor who could rid me of my satyr affectation, theother times to buy food and supplies. The Shrike Temple had renewed theShrike pilgrimages by this time, and on my trips I would use theirelaborate avenue to death in reverse- the walk to Chronos Keep, theaerial tram across the Bridle Range, the windwagons, and the Charonbarge down the Hoolie.Coming back, I would stare at the pilgrims and wonder who would survive.Few visited the City of Poets. Our half-finished towers began to looklike tumbled ruins. The gallerias with their splendid metal-glass domesand covered arcades grew heavy with vines; pyreweed and scargrass pokedup between the flagstones. The SDF added to the chaos, setting minesand booby traps to kill the Shrike, but only succeeding in devastatingonce beautiful sections of the city. Irrigation broke down. Theaqueduct collapsed. The desert encroached. 1 moved from room to roomin King Billy's abandoned palace, working on my poem, waiting for mymuse.When you think about it, the cause-effect begins to resemble some madlogic-loop by the data artist Carolus or perhaps a print by Escher: theShrike had come into existencebecause of the incantatory powers of my poem but the poem could not haveexisted without the threat/presence of the Shrike as muse. Perhaps Iwas a bit mad in those days.In a dozen years sudden death culled the city of dilettantes until onlythe Shrike and I remained. The annual passage of the Shrike Pilgrimagewas a minor irritation, a distant caravan crossing the desert to theTime Tombs. Sometimes a few figures returned, fleeing across vermilionsands to the refuge of Chronos Keep twenty kilometers to the southwest.More often, no one emerged.I watched from the shadows of the city. My hair and beard had grownuntil they covered some of the rags I wore. I came out mostly at night,moving through the ruins like a furtive shadow, sometimes gazing at mylighted palace tower like David Hume peering in his own windows andsolemnly deciding that he wasn't home. I never moved the foodsynthesizer from the dining dome to my apartments, preferring instead toeat in the echoing silence under that cracked duotoo like some addledEloi fattening himself up for the inevitable Morlock.I never saw the Shrike. Many nights, just before dawn, I would awakenfrom a nap at a sudden sound -the scratch of metal on stone, the rasp ofsand under something's foot - but although I was often sure that I wasbeing watched, I never saw the watcher.Occasionally I made the short trip to the Time Tombs, especially atnight, avoiding the soft, disconcerting tugs of the anti-entropic timetides while I moved through complicated shadows under the wings of theSphinx or stared at stars through the emerald wall of the Jade Tomb. Itwas upon my return from one of these nocturnal pilgrimages that I foundan intruder in my study.'Impressive, M-M-M-Martin,' said King Billy, tapping one of severalheaps of manuscript which lay about the room. Seated in the oversizedchair at the long table, the failed monarch looked old, more melted thanever. It was obvious that he had been reading for several hours.'Do you r-r-really think that mankind d-d-d-deservessuch an end?" he asked softly. It had been a dozen years since I hadheard the stutter.i moved away from the door but did not answer. Billy had been a friendand patron for more than twenty standard years, but at that moment Icould have killed him. The thought of someone reading Hyperion withoutpermission filled me with rage.'You d-d-date your p-p-p... cantos?" said King Billy, riffling throughthe most recent stack of completed pages.'How did you get here?" I snapped. It was not an idle question.Skimmers; dropships, and helicopters had not had much luck flying to theTime Tombs region in recent years. The machines arrived sanspassengers. It had done wonders in fueling the Shrike myth.The little man in the rumpled cape shrugged. His uniform was meant tobe brilliant and regal but merely made him look like an overweightHarlequin. '1 followed the last batch of pilgrims,' he said. 'And thenc-c-came down from Keep Chronos to visit. I notice that you've writtennothing in many months, M-M-Martin. Can you explain that?"I glowered in silence while sidling closer.'Perhaps I can explain it,' said King Billy. He looked at the lastcompleted page of Hyperion Cantos as if it had the answer to along-puzzled riddle. 'The last stanzas were written the same week lastyear that J.T. Telio disappeared."'So?" I had moved to the far edge of the table now.Feigning a casual attitude, I pulled a short stack of manuscript pagescloser and moved them out of Billy's reach.'So that w-w-w-was... according to the SDF monitors .. the d-d-dateof the death of the last remaining Poets' City dweller,' he said. 'Thelast except for y-y-you, that is, Martin."I shrugged and began moving around the table. 1 needed to get to Billywithout getting the manuscript in the way.'You know, you haven't f-f-f-finished it, Martin,' he said in his deep,sad voice. 'There is still some hance that humanity s-s-s-survives theFall."'No,' I said and sidled closer.'But you can't write it, can you, Martin? You can't c-c-c-compose thispoetry unless your m-m-muse is shedding blood, can you?"'Bullshit,' I said.'Perhaps. But a fascinating coincidence. Have you ever wondered whyyou have been spared, Martin?"I shrugged again and slid another stack of papers out of his reach. Iwas taller, stronger, and meaner than Billy, but I had to be sure thatnone of the manuscript would be damaged if he struggled as I lifted himout of his seat and threw him out.'It's t-t-t-time we did something about this problem,' said my patron.'No,' I said, 'it's time you left." I shoved the last stacks of poetryaside and raised my arms, surprised to see a brass candlestick in onehand.'Stop right there, please,' King Billy said softly and lifted a neuralstunner from his lap.I paused only a second. Then I laughed. 'You miserable little hangdogfraud,' I said. 'You couldn't use a fucking weapon if your lifedepended on it."I stepped forward to beat him up and throw him out.My cheek was against the stone of the courtyard but one eye was openenough for me to see that stars still shone through the brokenlatticework of the galleria dome. 1 could not blink. My limbs andtorso tingled with the pinpricks of returning sensation, as if my entirebody had fallen asleep and was now coming painfully awake. It made mewant to scream, but my jaw and tongue refused to work. Suddenly I waslifted and propped against a stone bench so that I could see thecourtyard and the dry fountain which Rithmet Corbet had designed. Thebronze Laocon wrestled with bronze snakes in the flickering illuminationof the predawn meteor showers.'I'm s-s-sorry, Martin,' came a familiar voice, 'b-b-but thism-m-madness has to end." King Billy came into my field of view carryinga tall stack of manuscript. Other heaps of pages lay on the shell ofthe fountain at t he foot of the metal Trojan. An open bucket ofkerosene sat nearby.I managed to blink. My eyelids moved like rusted iron.'The stun should w-wowear off any s-s-s... any minute,' said KingBilly. He reached into the fountain, raised a sheaf of manuscript, andignited it with a flick of his cigarette lighter.'No!" I managed to scream through clenched jaws.The flames danced and died. King Billy let the ashes drop into thefountain and lifted another stack of pages, rolling them into acylinder. Tears glistened on lined cheeks illuminated by flame. 'Youc-c-called it f-f-forth,' gasped the little man. 'It must bef-f-finished."I struggled to rise. My arms and legs jerked like a marionette'smishandled limbs. The pain was incredible.I screamed again and the agonized sound echoed from marble and granite.King Billy lifted a fat sheaf of papers and paused to read from the toppage: Without story or propBut my own weak mortality, I boreThe load of this eternal quietude,The unchanging gloom, and th three fixed shapes Ponderous upon my sensesa whole moon.For by my burning brain I measured sure Her silver seasons shedded onthe night And ever day by day I thought I grewMore gaunt and ghostly - Oftentimes I prayed, Intense, that Death wouMtake me from the vale And all its burdens - Gasping with despair Ofchange, hour after hour I cursed myself."King Billy raised his face to the stars and consigned this page toflame.'No!" I cried again and forced my legs to bend. I got to one knee,tried to steady myself with an arm ablaze with pinpricks, and fell on myside.The shadow in the cape lifted a stack too thick to roll and peered at itin the dim light.' Then I saw a wan faceNot pinned by human sorrows, but bright blanched By an immortal sicknesswhich kills not;It works a constant change, which happy deathCan put no end to; deathwards progressingTo no death was that visage; it had passedThe lily and the sno w; and beyond theseI must not think now, though Isaw that face..." ."King Billy moved his lighter and this and fifty other pages burst intoflame. He dropped the burning papers into the fountain and reached formore.'Please!" I cried and pulled myself up, stiffening my legs against thetwitches of random nerve impulses while leaning against the stone bench.'Please."The third figure did not actually appear so much as allow its presenceto impinge upon my consciousness; it was as if it always had been thereand King Billy and I had failed to notice it until the flames grewbright enough.Impossibly tall, four-armed, molded in chrome and cartilage, the Shriketurned its red gaze on us.King Billy gasped, stepped back, and then moved forward to feed morecantos to the fire. Embers rose on warm drafts. A flight of dovesburst from the vine-choked girders of the broken dome with an explosionof wing sound.I moved forward in a motion more lurch than step. The Shrike did notmove, did not shift its bloody gaze.'Go!" cried King Billy, stutter forgotten, voice exalted, a blazing massof poetry in each hand. 'Return to the pit whence you came!'The Shrike seemed to incline its head ever so slightly.Red light gleamed on sharp surfaces.'My lord!" I cried, although to King Billy or the apparition from hell Idid not know then and know not now. 1 staggered the last few paces andreached for Billy's arm.He was not there. One second the aging King was a hand's length from meand in the next instant he was ten meters away, raised high above thecourtyard stones. Fingers like steel thorns pierced his arms and chestand thighs, but he still writhed and my Cantos burned in his fists.The Shrike held him out like a father offering his son for baptism.'Destroy it!" Billy cried, his pinned arms making pitiful gestures.'Destroy it!'I stopped at the fountain's edge, tottered weakly against the rim. Atfirst 1 thought he meant destroy the Shrike... and then I thought hemeant the poem...and then I realized that he meant both. A thousand pages and more ofmanuscript lay tumbled in the dry fountain.I picked up the bucket of kerosene.The Shrike did not move except to pull King' Billy slowly back againsthis chest in an oddly affectionate motion. Billy writhed and screamedsilently as a long steel thorn emerged from his harlequin silk justabove the breastbone. I stood there stupidly and thought of butterflycollections I had displayed as a child. Slowly, mechanically, I sloshedkerosene on the scattered pages.'End it!" gasped King Billy. 'Martin, for the love of God!'I picked up the lighter from where he had dropped it.The Shrike made no move. Blood soaked the black patches of Billy'stunic until they blended with the crimson squares already here. Ithumbed the antique lighter once, twice, a third time; sparks only.Through my tears I could see my life's work lying in the dusty fountain.I dropped the lighter.Billy screamed. Dimly, I heard blades rubbing bone as he twisted in theShrike's embrace. 'Finish it!" he cried.'Martin... oh, God!'I turned then, took five fast paces, and threw the half-full bucket ofkerosene. Fumes blurred my already blurred vision. Billy and theimpossible creature that held him were soaked like two comics in aslapstick holie.I saw Billy blink and splutter, I saw the slickness on the Shrike'schiseled muzzle reflect the meteor-brightened sky, and then the dyingembers of burned pages in Billy's still clenched fists ignited thekerosene.I raised my hands to protect my face - too late, beard and eyebrowssinged and smoldered- and staggered backward until the rim of thefountain stopped me.For a second the pyre was a perfect sculpture of flame, a blue andyellow Piet with a four-armed madonna holding a blazing Christ figure.Then the burning figure writhed and arched, still pinned by steel thornsand a score of scalpeled talons, and a cry went up which to thisday I cannot believe emanated from the human half of that death-embracedpair. The scream knocked me to my knees, echoed from every hard surfacein the city, and drove the pigeons into wheeling panic. And the screamcontinued for minutes after the flaming vision simply ceased to be,leaving behind neither ashes nor retinal image. It was another minuteor two before I realized that the scream I now heard was mine.Anticlimax is, of course, the warp and way of things.Real life seldom structures a decent denouement.It took me several months, perhaps a year, to recopy thekerosene-damaged pages and to rewrite the burned Cantos. It will be nosurprise to learn that I did not finish the poem. It was not by choice.My muse had fled.The City of Poets decayed in peace. I stayed another year or two -perhaps five, I do not know; I was quite mad by then. To this dayrecords of early Shrike pilgrims tell of the gaunt figure, all hair andrags and bulging eyes, who would wake them from their Gethsemane sleepby screaming obscenities and shaking his fist at the silent Time Tombs,daring the coward within to show itself.Eventually the madness burned itself out - although the embers willalways glow - and I hiked the fifteen hundred kilometers tocivilization, my backpack weighted down with just manuscript, survivingon rock eels and snow and on nothing at all for the last ten days.The two and a half centuries since are not worth telling, much lessreliving. The Pouisen treatments to keep the instrument alive andwaiting. Two long, cold sleeps in illegal, sublight, cryogenic voyages;each swallowing a century or more; each taking its toll in brain cellsand memory.I waited then. I will still. The poem must be finished. It will befinished.In the beginning was the Word.In the end... past honor, past life, past caring...In the end will be the Word.FOURThe Benares put into Edge a little after noon on the next day. One ofthe mantas had died in harness only twenty kilometers downriver fromtheir destination and A. Bettik had cut it loose. The other had lasteduntil they tied up to the bleached pier and then it rolled over in totalexhaustion, bubbles rising from its twin airholes. Bettik ordered thismanta cut loose as well, explaining that it had a slim chance ofsurviving if it drifted along in the more rapid current.The pilgrims had been awake and watching the scenery roll by sincebefore sunrise. They spoke little and none had found anything to say toMartin Silenus. The poet did not appear to mind... he drank wine withhis breakfast and sang bawdy songs as the sun rose.The river had widened during the night and by morning it was atwo-kilometer-wide highway of blue gray cutting through the low greenhills south of the Sea of Grass. There were no trees this close to theSea, and the browns and golds and heather tones of the Mane shrubs hadgradually brightened to the bold greens of the two-meter-tall northerngrasses. All morning the hills had been pressed lower until now theywere compressed into low bands of grassy bluffs on either side of theriver.An almost invisible darkening hung above the horizon to the north andeast, and those pilgrims who had lived on ocean worlds and knew it as apromise of the approaching sea had to remind themselves that the onlysea now near was comprised of several billion acres of grass.Edge never had been a large outpost and now it was totally deserted. Thescore of buildings lining the rutted lane from the dock had the vacantgaze of all abandonedstructures and there were signs on the riverfront that the populationhad fled weeks earlier. The Pilgrims' Rest, a three-century-old innjust below the crest of the hill, had been burned.A. Bettik accompanied them to the summit of the low bluff. 'What willyou do now?" Colonel Kassad asked the android.'According to the terms of the Temple bonditure, we are free after thistrip,' said Bettik. ' We shall leave the Benares here for your returnand take the launch downriver. And then we go on our way."'With the general evacuations?" asked Brawne Lamia.'No." Bettik smiled. 'We have our own purposes and pilgrimages onHyperion."The group reached the rounded crest of the bluff.Behind them, the Benare seemed a small thing tied to a sagging dock; theHoolie ran southwest into the blue haze of distance below the town andcurved west above it, narrowing toward the impassable Lower Cataracts adozen kilometers uprivcr from Edge. To their north and cast lay the Seaof Grass.'My God,' breathed Brawne Lamia.It was as if they had climbed the last hill in creation.Below them, a scattering of docks, . wharves, and sheds marked the endof Edge and the beginning of t he Sea. Grass stretched away forever,rippling sensuously in the slight breeze and seeming to lap like a greensurf at the base of the bluffs. The grass seemed infinite and seamless,stretching tO all horizons and apparently rising to precisely the sameheight as far as the eye could see. There was not the slightest hint ofthe snowy peaks of the Bridle Range, which they knew lay some eighthundred kilometers to the northwest.The illusion that they were gazing at a great green sea was nearlyperfect, down to the wind-ruffled shimmers of stalks looking likewhitecaps far from shore.'It's beautiful,' said Lamia, who had never seen it before.'It's striking at sunset and sunrise,' said the Consul.'Fascinating,' murmured Sol Weintraub, lifting his infant so that shecould see. She wiggled in happiness and concentrated on watching herfingers.'A well-preserved ecosystem,' Het Masteen saidapprovingly. 'The Muir would be pleased." 'Shit,' said Martin Silenus.The others turned to stare.'There's no fucking windwagon,' said the poet.The four other men, woman, and android stared silentlyat the abandoned wharves and empty plain of grass.' It's been delayed,' said the Consul.Martin Silenus barked a laugh. 'Or it's left already. We were supposedto be here last night."Colonel Kassad raised his powered binoculars and swept the horizon. 'Ifind it unlikely that they would have left without us,' he said. 'Thewagon was to have been sent by the Shrike Temple priests themselves.They have a vested interest in our pilgrimage."'We could walk,' said Lenar Hoyt. The priest looked pale and weak,obviously in the grip of both pain and drugs, and barely able to stand,much less walk.' No,' said Kassad. ' It' s hundreds o f klic ks and the grass is overour heads."'Compasses,' said the priest.'Compasses don't work on Hyperion,' said Kassad, still watching throughhis binoculars.'Direction finders then,' said Hoyt.'We have an IDF, but that isn't the point,' said the Consul.'The grass is sharp. Halfa klick out and we'd be nothing but tatters."'And there are the grass serpents,' said Kassad, lowering the glasses.'It's a well-preserved ecosystem but not one to take a stroll in."Father Hoyt sighed and half collapsed into the short grass of thehilltop. There was something close to relief in his voice when he said.'All right, we go back."A. Bettik stepped forward. 'The crew will be happy to wait and ferryyou back to Keats in the Benares should the windwagon not appear."'No,' said the Consul, 'take the launch and go."'Hey, just a fucking minute!" cried Martin Silenus. 'I don't rememberelecting you dictator, amigo. We need to get there. If the fuckingwindwagon doesn't show, we'!!have to find another way."The Consul wheeled to face the smaller man. 'How?By boat? It takes two weeks to sail up the Mane and around the NorthLittoral to Otho or one of the other staging areas. And that's whenthere are ships available.Every seagoing vessel on Hyperion is probably involved in the evacuationeffort."'Dirigible then,' growled the poet.Brawne Lamia laughed. 'Oh, yes. We've seen so many in the two dayswe've been on the river."Martin Silenus whirled and clenched his fists as if to strike the woman.Then he smiled. 'All right then, lady, what do we do? Maybe if wesacrifice someone to a grass serpent the transportation gods will smileon as."Brawne Lamia's stare was arctic. 'I thought burned offerings were moreyour style, little man."Colonel Kassad stepped between the two. His voice barked command.'Enough. The Consul's right. We stay here until the wagon arrives. M.Masteen, M. Lamia, go with A. Bettik to supervise the unloading of ourgear.Father Hoyt and M. Silenus will bring some wood up for a bonfire."'A bonfire?" said the priest. It was hot on the hillside.'After dark,' said Kassad. 'We want the windwagon to know we're here.Now let's move."It was a quiet group that watched the powered launch move downriver atsunset. Even from two kilometers away the Consul could see the blueskins of the crew. The Benares looked old and abandoned at its wharf,already a part of the deserted city. When the launch was lost in thedistance, the group turned to watch the Sea of Grass.Long shadows from the river bluffs crept out across what the Consulalready found himself thinking of as the surf and shallows. Fartherout, the sea seemed to shift in color, the grass mellowing to anaquamarine shimmer before darkening to a hint of verdurous depths. Thelapis sky melted into the reds and golds of sunset, illuminating theirhilltop and setting the pilgrims' skins aglow with liquid light. Theonly sound was the whisper of wind in grass.'We've got a fucking huge heap of baggage,' Martin Silenus said loudly.'For a bunch of folks on a one-way trip."It was true, thought the Consul. Their luggage made a small mountain onthe grassy hilltop.'Somewhere in there,' came the quiet voice of Het Masteen, 'may lie oursalvation."'What do you mean?" asked Brawne Lamia.'Yeah,' said Martin Silenus, lying back, putting his hands under hishead, and staring at the sky. 'Did you bring a pair of undershorts thatare ShrikeProof?. 'The Templar shook his head slowly. The sudden twilight cast his face inshadow under the cowl of the robe.'Let us not trivialize or dissemble,' he said. 'It is time to admitthat each of us has brought on this pilgrimage something which he or shehopes will alter the inevitable outcome when the moment arrives that wemust face the Lord of Pain."The poet laughed. 'I didn't bring even my lucky fucking rabbit's foot."The Templar's hood moved slightly. 'But your manuscript perhaps?"The poet said nothing.Het Masteen moved his invisible gaze to the tall man on his left. 'Andyou, Colonel, there are several trunkswhich bear your name. Weapons, perhaps?"Kassad raised his head but did not speak.'Of course,' said Het Masteen, 'it would be foolish to go huntingwithout a weapon."'What about me?" asked Brawne Lamia, folding her arms. 'Do you knowwhat secret weapon I've smuggled along?"The Templar's oddly accented voice was calm. 'We have not yet heardyour tale, M. Lamia. It would be premature to speculate."'What about the Consul?" asked Lamia.'Oh, yes, it is obvious what weapon our diplomatic friend has in store."The Consul turned from his contemplation of the sunset. '1 brought onlysome clothes and two books to read,' he said truthfully.'Ah,' sighed the Templar, 'but what a beautiful spacecraft you leftbehind."Martin Silenus jumped to his feet. 'The fucking ship!' he cried. 'Youcan call it, can't you? Well, goddammit, get your dog whistle out, l'mtired of sitting here."The Consul pulled a strand of grass and stripped it.After a minute he said:'Even if I could call it... and you heard A. Bettik say that thecomsats and repeater stations were down...even if I could call it, we couldn't land north of the Bridle Range.That meant instant disaster even before the Shrike began ranging southof the mountains."'Yeah,' said Silenus, waving his arms in agitation, 'but we could getacross this fucking... lawn! Call the ship."'Walt until morning,' said the Consul. 'If the wind-wagon's not here,we will discuss alternatives."'Fuck that..." began the poet, but Kassad stepped forward with his backto him, effectively removing Silenus from the circle.'M. Masteen,' said the Colonel, 'what is your secret?" There was enoughlight from the dying sky to show a slight smile on the Templar's thinlips. He gestured toward the mound of baggage. 'As you see, my trunkis the heaviest and most mysterious of all."'It's a MObius cube,' said Father Hoyt. 'l've seenancient artifacts transported that way."'Or fusion bombs,' said Kassad.Het Masteen shook his head. 'Nothing so crude,' he said.'Are you going to tell us?" demanded Lamia.'When it is my turn to speak,' said the Templar.'Are you next?" asked the Consul. 'We can listen while we wait."Sol Weintraub cleared his throat. 'I have number four,' he said,showing the slip of paper. 'But I would be more than pleased to tradewith the True Voice of the Tree." Weintraub lifted Rachel from his leftshoulder to his right, patting her gently on the back.Het Masteen shook his head. 'No, there is time. 1 meant only to pointout that in hopelessness there is always hope. We have learned muchfrom the stories sofar. Yet each of us has some seed of promise buried even deeper than wehave admitted."'I don't see . . ." began Father Hoyt but was interrupted by MartinSilenus's sudden shout.'It's the wagon! The fucking windwagon. Here at last!'It was another twenty minutes before the windwagon tied up to one of thewharves. The craft came out of the north, its sails white squaresagainst a dark plain draining of color. The last light had faded by thetime the large ship had tacked close to the low bluff, folded its mainsails, and rolled to a stop.The Consul was impressed. The thing was wooden, handcrafted, and huge -curved in the pregnant lines of some seagoing galleon out of Old Earth'sancient history.The single gigantic wheel, set in the center of the curving hull,normally would have been invisible in the two-meter-tall grass, but theConsul caught a glimpse of the underside as he carried luggage onto thewharf. From the ground it would be six or seven meters to the railing,and more than five times that height to the tip of the mainmast. Fromwhere he stood, panting from exertion, the Consul could hear the snap ofpennants far above and a steady, almost subsonic hum that would becoming from either the ship's interior flywheel or its massivegyroscopes.A gangplank extruded from the upper hull and lowered itself to thewharf. Father Hoyt and Brawne Lamia had to step back quickly or becrushed.The windwagon was less well lighted than the Benares; illuminationappeared to consist of several lanterns hanging from spars. No crew hadbeen visible during the approach of the ship and no one came into viewnOW.'Hallo!" called the Consul from the base of the gangplank.No one answered.'Wait here a minute, please,' said Kassad and mounted the long ramp infive strides.The others watched while Kassad paused at the top, touched his beltwhere the small deathwand was tucked,and then disappeared amidships. Several minutes later a light flaredthrough broad windows at the stern, casting trapezoids of yellow on thegrass below.'Come up,' called Kassad from the head of the ramp.'It's empty."The group struggled with their luggage, making several trips. TheConsul helped Her Masteen with the heavy MObius cube and through hisfingertips he could feel a faint but intense vibration.'So where the fuck is the crew?" asked Martin Silenus when they wereassembled on the foredeck. They had taken their single-file tourthrough the narrow corridors and cabins, down stairways more ladder thanstairs, and through cabins not much bigger than the built-in bunks theycontained. Only the rearmost cabin - the captain's cabin, if that iswhat it was - approached the size and comfort of standard accommodationson the Benares.'It's obviously automated,' said Kassad. The FORCE officer pointed tohalyards which disappeared into slots in the deck, manipulators all butinvisible among the rigging and spars, and the subtle hint of gearshalfway up the lateen-rigged rear mast.'I didn't see a control center,' said Lamia. 'Not so much as a diskeyor C-spot nexus." She slipped her comlog from a breast pocket and triedto interface on standard data, comm, and biomed frequencies. There wasno response from the ship.'The ships used to be crewed,' said the Consul. 'Temple initiates usedto accompany the pilgrims to the mountains."'We!!, they're not here now,' said Hoyt. 'But I guess we can assumethat someone is still alive at the tram station or Keep Chronos. Theysent the wagon for us."'Or everyone's dead and the windwagon is running on an automaticschedule,' said Lamia. She looked over her shoulders as rigging andcanvas creaked in a suddengust of wind. 'Damn, it's weird to be cut offfrom everybody and everything like this. It's like being blind anddeaf. 1 don't know how colonials stand it."Martin Silenus approached the group and sat on the railing. He drankfrom a long green bottle and said:'Where's the Poet? Show him! Show him,Muses mine, that I may know him!'Tis the man who with a manIs an equal, be he king,Or poorest of the beggar-class,Or any other wondrous thingA man may be 'twixt ape and Plato.'Tis the man who with a bird,Wren or eagle, finds his way toA !! its instincts. He hath heardThe !ion's roaring, and can tellWhat his horny throat expresseth, And to him the tiger's yellComes articulate and pressethOn his ear like mother-tongue. ''Where did you get that wine bottle?" asked Kassad.Martin Silenus smiled. His eyes were small and bright in the lanternglow. 'The gailery's fully stocked and there's a bar. I declared itopen."'We should fix some dinner,' said the Consul although all he wanted atthe moment was some wine. It had been more than ten hours since theyhad last eaten.There came a clank and whir and all six of them moved to the starboardrail. The gangplank had drawn itself in.They whirled again as canvas unfurled, lines grew taut, and somewhere aflywheel hummed into the ultrasonic.Sails filled, the deck tilted slightly, and the windwagon moved awayfrom the wharf and into the darkness. The only sounds were the flap andcreak of the ship, the distant rumble of the wheel, and the rasp ofgrass on the hull bottom.The six of them watched as the shadow of the bluff fell behind, theunlighted beacon pyre receding as a faint gleam of starlight on palewood, and then there were only the sky and night and swaying circles oflantern light.'I'11 go below,' said the Consul, 'and see if I can get a mealtogether."The others stayed awhile, feeling the slight surge and rumble throughthe soles of their feet and watchingdarkness pass. The Sea of Grass was visible only as the place wherestars ended and flat blackness began. Kassad used a handbeam toilluminate glimpses of canvas and rigging, lines being pulled tight byinvisible !ands, and then he checked all the corners and shadowed placesfrom stern to bow. The others watched in silence. When he clicked thelight off, the darkness seemed less oppressive, the starlight brighter.A rich, fertile smell - more of a farm in springtime than of the sea -came to them on a breeze which had swept across a thousand kilometers ofgrass.Sometime later the Consul called to them and they went below to eat.The galley was cramped and there was no mess table, so they used thelarge cabin in the stern as their common room, pushing three of thetrunks together as a makeshift table. Four lanterns swinging from lowbeams made the room bright. A breeze blew in when Het Masteen openedone of the tall windows above the bed..The Consul set plates piled high with sandwiches on the largest trunkand returned again with thick white cups and a coffee therm. He pouredwhile the others ate.'This is quite good,' said Fedmahn Kassad. 'Where did you get the roastbeen''The cold box is fully stocked. There's another large freezer in theaft pantry."'Electrical?" asked Het Masteen.'No. Double insulated."Martin Silenus sniffed ajar, found a knife on the sandwich plate, andadded great dollops of horseradish to his sandwiches. His eyes sparkledwith tears as he ate.'How long does this crossing generally take?" Lamia asked the Consul.He looked up from his study of the circle of hot black coffee in hiscup. T m sorry, what?"'Crossing the Sea of Grass. How long?"'A night and half a day to the mountains,' said the Consul. 'If thewinds are with us."'And then... how long to cross the mountains?" asked Father Hoyt.'Less than a day,' sid the Consul.'If the tramway is running,' added Kassad.The Consul sipped the hot coffee and made a face.'We have to assume it is. Otherwise..."'Otherwise what?" demanded Lamia.'Otherwise,' said Colonel Kassad, moving to the open window and puttinghis hands on his hips, 'we will he stranded six hundred klicks from theTime Tombs and a thousand from the southern cities."The Consul shook his head. 'No,' he said. 'The Temple. priests orwhoever are behind this pilgrimage have seen to it that we've gottenthis far. They'll make sure we go all the way."Brawne Lamia crossed her arms and frowned. 'As what... sacrifices?"Martin Silenus whooped a laugh and brought out his bottle:'Who are these coming to the sacrifice?To what green altar, 0 mysterious priest, Lead'st thou that heiferlowing at the skies,And all her silken flanks with garlands dressed?What little town by river or sea-shore,Or mountain-built with peaceful citadel,Is emptied of its folk, this pious morn?And, little town, thy streets for evermore Will silent be; and not asoul, to tell Why thou art desolate, can e'er return. 'Brawne Lamia reached under her tunic and brought out a cutting laser nolarger than her little finger. She aimed it at the poet's head. 'Youmiserable little shit.One more word out of you and... 1 swear... I'll slag you where youstand."The silence was suddenly absolute except for the background rumble-groanof the ship. The Consul moved toward Martin Silenus. Colonel Kassadtook two steps behind Lamia.The poet took a long drink and smiled at the dark-haired woman. Hislips were moist. 'Oh build your ship of death,' he whispered. 'Ohbuild it!'Lamia's fingers were white on the pencil laser. The Consul edged closerto Silenus, not knowing what to do, imagining the whipping beam of lightfusing his own eyes.Kassad leaned toward Lamia like two meters of tensed shadow.'Madam,' said Sol Weintraub from where he sat on the bunk against thefar wall, 'need I remind you that there is a child present?"Lamia glanced to her right. Weintraub had removed a deep drawer from aship's cupboard and had set it on the bed as a cradle. He had bathedthe infant and come in silently just before the poet's recitation. Nowhe set the baby softly in the padded nest.'l'm sorry,' said Brawne Lamia and lowered the small laser." It's justthat he makes me so... angry."Weintraub nodded, rocking the drawer slightly. The gentle roll of thewindwagon combined with the incessant rumble of the great wheel appearedto have already put the child to sleep. 'We're all tired and tense,'said the scholar.'Perhaps we should find our lodgings for the night and turn in."The woman sighed and tucked the weapon in her belt." I won't sleep,' shesaid. 'Things are too... strange."Others nodded. Martin Silenus was sitting on the broad ledge below thestern windows. Now he pulled up his legs, took a drink, and said toWeintraub, 'Tell your story, old man."'Yes,' said Father Hoyt. The priest looked exhausted to the point ofbeing cadaverous, but his feverish eyes burned. 'Tell us. We need tohave the stories told and time to think about them before we arrive."Weintraub passed a hand across his bald scalp. 'It's a dull tale,' hesaid." l've been to Hyperion be fore. There are no confrontations withmonsters, no acts of heroism. It's a tale by a man whose idea of epicadventure is speaking to a class without his notes."'All the better,' said Martin Silenus. 'We need a soporific."Sol Weintraub sighed, adjusted his glasses, and nodded.There were a few streaks of dark in his heard, but most of it had gonegray. He turned the lantern low over the baby'sbed and moved to a chair in the center of the room.The Consul turned down the other lamps and poured more coffee for thosewho wanted it. Sol Weintraub's voice was slow, careful in phrase andprecise in wording, and before long the gentle cadence of his storyblended with the soft rumble and slow pitchings of the windwagon'sprogress north.THE SCHOLAR'S TALE:The River Lethe's Taste is BitterSol Weintraub and his wife Sarai had enjoyed their life even before thebirth of their daughter; Rachel made things as close to perfect as thecouple could imagine.Sarai was twenty-seven when the child was conceived, Sol wastwenty-nine. Neither of them had considered Poulsen treatments becauseneither of them could afford it, but even without such care they lookedforward to another fifty years of health.Both had lived their entire lives on Barnard's World, one of the oldestbut least exciting members of the Hegemony. Barnard's was in the Web,but it made little difference to Sol and Sarai since they could notafford frequent farcaster travel and had little wish to go at any rate.Sol had recently celebrated his tenth year with Nightenhelser College,where he taught history and classical studies and did his own researchon ethical evolution.Nightenhelser was a small school, fewer than three thousand students,but its academic reputation was outstanding and it attracted youngpeople from all over the Web. The primary complaint of these studentswas that Nightenhelser and its surrounding community of Crawfordconstituted an island of civilization in an ocean of corn. It was true;the college was three thousand flat kilometers away from the capital ofBussard and the terraformed land in between was given over to farming.There had been no forests to fell, no hills to deal with, and nomountains to break the flat monotony of cornfields, bean-fields,cornfields, wheatfields, cornfields, rice paddies, and cornfields. Theradical poet SalmudBrevy had taught briefly at Nightenhelser before the Glennon-HeightMutiny, had been fired, and upon far-casting to Renaissance Vector hadtold his friends that Crawford County on South Sinzer on Barnard's Worldconstituted the Eighth Circle of Desolation on the smallest pimple onthe absolute ass-end of Creation.Sol and Sarai Weintraub liked it. Crawford, a town of twenty-fivethousand, might have been reconstructed from some nineteenth-centurymid-American template.The streets were wide and over-arched with elms and oaks. (Barnard'shad been the second extrasolar Earth colony, centuries before theHawking drive and Hegira, and the seedships then had been huge.) Homesin Crawford reflected styles ranging from early Victorian to CanadianRevival, but they all seemed to be white and set far back onweil-trimmed lawns.The college itself was Georgian, an assemblage of red brick and whitepillars surrounding the oval common.Sol's office was on the third floor of Placher Hall, the oldest buildingon campus, and in the winter he could look out on bare branches whichcarved the common into complex geometries. Sol loved the chalk-dust andold-wood smell of the place, a smell which had not changed since he wasa freshman there, and each day climbing to his office he treasured thedeeply worn grooves in the steps, a legacy of twenty generations ofNightenhelser students.Sarai had been born on a farm halfway between Bussard and Crawford andhad received her PhD in music theory a year before Sol earned hisdoctorate. She had been a happy and energetic young woman, making up inpersonality what she lacked in accepted norms of physical beauty, andshe carried this attractiveness of person into later life. Sarai hadstudied offworld for two years at the University of New Lyons on DenebDrei, but she was homesick there: the sunsets were abrupt, themuch-vaunted mountains slicing off the sunlight like a ragged scythe,and she longed for the hours-long sunsets of home where Barnard's Starhung on the horizon like a great, tethered, red balloon while the skycongealed to evening. She missed the perfect flatness where - peeringfrom her third-floor room under the steep gables- a little girl couldlook fifty kilometers across tasseled fields to watch a storm approachlike a bruise-black curtain lit within by lightning bolts. And Saraimissed her family.She and Sot met a week after she transferred to Night-enhelser; it wasanother three years before he proposed marriage and she accepted. Atfirst she saw nothing in the short graduate student. She was stillwearing Web fashions then, involved in Post-Destructionist musictheories, reading Obit and Nihil and the most avant-garde magazines fromRenaissance Vector and TC2, feigning sophisticated weariness with lifeand a rebel's vocabulary - and none of this jelled with the undersized.but earnest history major who spilled fruit cocktail on her at DeanMoore's honors party. Any exotic qualities which might have come fromSol Weintraub's Jewish legacy were instantly negated by his BW accent,his Crawford Squire Shop wardrobe, and the fact that he had come to theparty with a copy of Detresque's Solitudes in Variance absentmindedlytucked under his arm.For Sol it was love at first sight. He stared at the laughing,red-cheeked girl and ignored the expensive dress and affected mandarinnails in favor of the personality which blazed like a beacon to thelonely junior. Sol had not known he was lonely until he met Sarai, butafter the first time he shook her hand and spilled fruit salad down thefront of her dress he knew that his life would be empty forever if theydid not marry.They married the week after the announcement of Sol's teachingappointment at the college. Their honeymoon was on Maui-Covenant, hisfirst farcast trip abroad, and for three weeks they rented a mobile isleand sailed alone on it through the wonders of the EquatorialArchipelago. Sol never forgot the images from those sun-drenched andwind-filled days, and the secret image he would always most cherish wasof Sarai rising nude from a nighttime swim, the Core stars blazing abovewhile her own body glowed constellations from the phosphorescence of theisland's wake.They had wanted a child immediately but it was to be five years beforenature agreed.Sol remembered cradling Sarai in his arms as she curled in pain, adifficult delivery, until finally, incredibly, Rachel Sarah Weintraubwas born at 2:01 A.M. in Crawford County Med Center.The presence of an infant intruded upon Sol's solipsistic life as aserious academic and Sarai's profession as music critic for Barnard'sdatasphere, but neither minded. The first months were a blend ofconstant fatigue and joy. Late at night, between feedings, Sol wouldtiptoe into the nursery just to check on Rachel and to stand and gaze atthe baby. More often than not he would find Sarai already there and thetwo would watch, arm in arm, at the miracle of a baby sleeping on itsstomach, rump in the air, head burrowed into the bumper pad at the headof the crib.Rachel was one of those rare children who managed to be cute withoutbecoming self-consciously precious; by the time she was two standardyears old her appearance and personality were striking - her mother'slight brown hair, red cheeks, and broad smile, her father's large browneyes. Friends said that the child combined the best portions of Sarai'ssensitivity and Sol's intellect.Another friend, a child psychologist from the college, once commentedthat Rachel at age five showed the most reliable indicators of truegiftedness in a young person: structured curiosity, empathy for others,compassion, and a fierce sense of fair play.One day in his office, studying ancient files from Old Earth, Sol wasreading about the effect of Beatrice on the world view of DanteAlighieri when he was struck by a passage written by a critic from thetwentieth or twenty-first century:She [Beatrice] alone was still real for him, still implied meaning inthe world, and beauty. Her nature became his landmark- what Melvillewould call, with more sobriety than we can now muster, his GreenwichStandard...Sol paused to access the definition of Greenwich Standard, and then heread on. The critic had added a personal note:Most of us, I hope, have had some child or spouse or friend likeBeatrice, someone who by his very nature, his seemingly innate goodnessand intelligence, makes us uncomfortably conscious of our lies when welie.Sol had shut off the display and gazed out at the black geometries ofbranches above the common.Rachel was not insufferably perfect. When she was five standard, shecarefully cut the hair of her five favorite dolls and then cut her ownhair shortest of all. When she was seven, she decided that the migrantworkers staying in their run-down houses on the south end of town lackeda nutritious diet, so she emptied the house's pantries, cold boxes,freezers, and synthesizer banks, talked three friends into accompanyingher, and distributed several hundred marks' worth of the family'smonthly food budget.When she was ten, Rachel responded to a dare from Stubby Berkowitz andtried to climb to the top of Crawford's oldest elm. She was fortymeters up, less than five meters from the top, when a branch broke andshe fell two thirds of the way to the ground. Sol was paged on hiscomlog while discussing the moral implications of Earth's first nucleardisarmament era and he left the class without a word and ran the twelveblocks to the Med Center.Rachel had broken her left leg, two ribs, punctured a lung, andfractured her jaw. She was floating in a bath of recovery nutrient whenSol burst in, but she managed to look over her mother's shoulder, smileslightly, and say through the wire cast on her jaw: 'Dad, I was fifteenfeet from the top. Maybe closer. I'll make it next time."Rachel graduated with honors from secondary tutorials and receivedscholarship offers from corporate academies on five worlds and threeuniversities, including Harvard on New Earth. She chose Nightenhelser.it was little surprise to Sol that his daughter chosearchaeology as a major. One of his fondest memories of her was the longafternoons she had spent under the front porch when she was about two,digging in the loam, ignoring spiders and googlepeds, rushing into thehouse to show off every plastic plate and tarnished pfennig she hadexcavated, demanding to know where it had come from, what were thepeople like who had left it there?"Rachel received her undergraduate degree when she was nineteen standard,worked that summer on her grandmother's farm, and farcast away the nextfall. She was at Reichs University on Freeholm for twenty-eight localmonths, and when she returned it was as if color had flowed back intoSol and Sarai's world.For two weeks their daughter - an adult now, self-aware and secure insome ways that grown-ups twice her age often failed to be - rested andreveled in being home.One evening, walking across the campus just after sunset, she pressedher father on details of his heritage.'Dad, do you still consider yourself a Jew?"Sol had run his hand over his thinning hair, surprised by the question.'A Jew? Yes, I suppose so. It doesn't mean what it once did, though."'Am I a Jew?" asked Rachel. Her cheeks glowed in the fragile light.'If you want to be,' said Sol. 'It doesn't have the same significancewith Old Earth gone."'If l'd been a boy, would you have had me circumcised?"Sol had laughed, delighted and embarrassed by the question.'l'm serious,' said Rachel.Sol adjusted his glasses. 'I guess I would have, kiddo. I neverthought about it."'Have you been to the synagogue in Bussard?"'Not since my bar mitzvah,' said Sol, thinking back to the day fiftyyears earlier when his father had borrowed Uncle Richard's Vikken andhad flown the family to the capital for the ritual.'Dad, why do Jews feel that things are... less important now thanbefore the Hegira?"Sol spread his hands - strong hands, more those of a stoneworker than anacademic. 'That's a good question, Rachel. Probably because so much ofthe dream is dead.Israel is gone. The New Temple lasted less time than the first andsecond. God broke His word by destroying the Earth a second time in theway He did. And this Diaspora is... forever."'But Jews maintain their ethnic and religious identity in some places,'his daughter insisted.'Oh, sure. On Hebron and isolated areas of the Concourse you can findentire communities . . . Hasidic, Orthodox, Hasmonean, you name it...but they tend tobe... nonvital, picturesque... tourist-oriented." 'Like a theme park?"'Yes."'Could you take me to Temple Beth-el tomorrow? I can borrow Khaki'sstrat."'No need,' said Sol. 'We'll use the co!lege's shuttle." He paused.'Yes,' he said at last, 'I would like to take you to the synagoguetomorrow."It was getting dark under the old elms. Streetlights came on up anddown the wide lane which led to their home.'Dad,' said Rachel, 'l'm going to ask you a question l've asked about amillion times since I was two. Do you believe in God?"Sol had not smiled. He had no choice but to give her the answer he hadgiven her a million times. 'l'm waiting to,' he said.Rachel's postgraduate work dealt with alien and pre-Hegira artifacts.For three standard years Sol and Sarai would receive occasional visitsfollowed by fatline flim-sies from exotic worlds near but not within theWeb. They all knew that her field work in quest of dissertation wouldsoon take her beyond the Web, into the Outback where time-debt ate awayat the lives and memories of those left behind.'Where the hell is Hyperion?" Sarai had asked during Rachei's lastvacation before the expedition left.'It sounds like a brand name' for some new household product."'It's a great place, Mom. There are more nonhuman artifacts there thanany place except Armaghast."'Then why not go to Armaghast?" said Sarai. 'It's only a few monthsfrom the Web. Why settle for second best?"'Hyperion hasn't become the big tourist attraction yet,' said Rachel.'Although they're beginning to become a problem. People with money aremore willing to travel outside the Web now."Sol had found his voice suddenly husky. 'Will you be going to thelabyrinth or the artifacts called the Time Tombs?"'The Time Tombs, Dad. I'll be.working with Dr Melio Arundez and heknows more about the Tombs than anyone alive."'Aren't they dangerous?" asked Sol, framing the question as casually ashe could but heating the edge in his voice.Rachel smiled. 'Because of the Shrike legend? No.Nobody's been bothered by that particular legend for two standardcenturies."'But I've seen documents about the trouble there during the secondcolonization..." began Sol.'Me too, Dad. But they didn't know about the big rock eels that camedown into the desert to hunt. They probably lost a few people to thosethings and panicked. You know how legends begin. Besides, the rockeels have been hunted to extinction."'Spacecraft don't !and there,' persisted Sol. 'You have to sail to theTombs. Or hike. Or some damn thing."Rachel laughed. 'In the early days, people flying in underestimated theeffects of the anti-entropic fields and there were some accidents. Butthere's dirigible service now. They have a big hotel called KeepChronos at the north edge of the mountains where hundreds of tourists ayear stay."'Will you be staying there?" asked Sarai.'Part of the time. It'll be exciting, Mom."'Not too exciting, I hope,' said Sarai and all of them had smiled.During the four years that Rachel was in transit - a few weeks ofcryogenic fugue for her - Sol found that he missed his daughter muchmore than if she had been out of touch but busy somewhere in the Web.The thought that she was flying away from him faster than the speed oflight, wrapped in the artificial quantum cocoon of the Hawking effect,seemed unnatural and ominous to him.They kept busy. Sarai retired from the critic business to devote moretime to local environmental issues, but for Sol it was one of the mosthectic times of his life.His second and third books came out and the second one - Moral TurningPoints - caused such a stir that he was in constant demand at offworldconferences and symposia. He traveled to a few alone, to a few morewith Sarai, but although both of them enjoyed the idea of traveling, theactual experience of facing strange foods, different gravities, and thelight from strange suns all paled after a while and Sol found himselfspending more time at home researching his next book, attendingconferences, if he had to, via interactive holo from the college.It was almost five years after Rachel left on her expedition that Solhad a dream which would change his life.Sol dreamed that he was wandering through a great structure with columnsthe size of small redwood trees and a ceiling lost to sight far abovehim, through which red light fell in solid shafts. At times he caughtglimpses of things far off in the gloom to his left or right: once hemade out a pair of stone legs rising like massive buildings through thedarkness; another time he spied what appeared to be a crystal scarabrotating far above him, its insides ablaze with cool lights.Finally Sol stopped to rest. Far behind him he could hear what soundedlike a great conflagration, entire cities and forests burning. Ahead ofhim glowed the lights he had been walking toward, two ovals of deepestred.He was mopping sweat from his brow when an immense voice said to him:'Sol! Take your daughter, your only daughter Rachel, whom you love, andgo to the world called Hyperion and offer her there as a burnt offeringat one of the places of which I shall tell you."And in his dream Sol had stood and said, 'You can't be serious." And hehad walked on through darkness, the red orbs glowing now like bloodymoons hanging above an indistinct plain, and when he stopped to rest theimmense voice said:'Sol! Take your daughter, your only daughter Rachel, whom you love, andgo to the world called Hyperion and offer her there as a burnt offeringat one of the places of which I shall tell you."And SOl had shrugged off the weight of the voice and had said distinctlyinto the darkness, 'I heard you the first time... the answer is stillno."SO! knew he was dreaming then, and part of his mind enjoyed the ironyof the script, but another part wanted only to waken. Instead, he foundhimself on a low balcony looking down on a room where Rachel lay nakedon a broad block of stone. The scene was illuminated by the glow of thetwin red orbs. Sol looked down at his right hand and found a long,curved knife there. The blade and handle appeared to be made of bone.The voice, sounding more than ever to Sol like some cut-rate holiedirector's shallow idea of what God's voice should sound like, cameagain:'SOl! You must listen well. The future of humankind depends upon yourobedience in this matter.You must take your daughter, your daughter Rachel whom you love, and goto the world called Hyperion and offer her there as a burnt offering atone of the places of which I shall tell you."And Sol, sick of the whole dream yet somehow alarmed by it, had turnedand thrown the knife far into the darkness.When he turned back to find his daughter, thescene had faded. The red orbs hung closer than ever, and now So! couldsee that they were multifaceted gems the size of small worlds.The amplified voice came again:'So? You have had your chance, SOl Weintraub.If you change your mind, you know where to find me."And SOl awakened half laughing, half chilled by the dream. Amused bythe thought that the entire Talmud and the Old Testament might benothing more than a cosmic shaggy-dog story.About the time Sol was having his dream, Rachel was on Hyperionfinishing her first year of research there. The team of ninearchaeologists and six physicists had found Keep Chronos fascinating butfar too crowded with tourists and would-be Shrike pilgrims, so after thefirst month spent commuting from the hotel, they had set up a permanentcamp between the ruined city and the small canyon holding the TimeTombs.While half the team excavated the more recent site of the unfinishedcity, two of Rache!'s colleagues helped her catalogue every aspect ofthe Tombs. The physicists were finished with the anti-entropic fieldsand spent much of their time setting small flags of different colors tomark the limits of the so-called time tides.Rachel's team concentrated their work in the structure called theSphinx, although the creature represented in stone was neither human norlion; it may not have been a creature at all, although the smooth linesatop the stone monolith suggested curves of a living thing, and thesweeping appendages made everyone think of wings.Unlike the other Tombs, which lay open and were easily inspected, theSphinx was a mass of heavy blocks honey-combed with narrow corridors,some of which tightened to impossibility, some of which widened toauditorium-sized proportions, but none of which led anywhere but back onthemselves. There were no crypts, treasure rooms, plundered sarcophogi,wall murals, or secretpassages, merely a maze of senseless corridors through sweating stone.Rachel and her lover, Melio Arundez, began mapping the Sphinx, using amethod which had been in use for at least seven hundred years, havingbeen pioneered in the Egyptian pyramids sometime in the twentiethcentury.Arranging sensitive radiation and cosmic ray detectors at the lowestpoint in the Sphinx, they recorded arrival times and deflection patternsof the particles passing through the mass of stone above them, watchingfor hidden rooms or passages which would not show up even on deepimaging radar. Because of the busy tourist season and the concern ofthe Hyperion Home Rule Council that the Tombs might be damaged by suchresearch, Rachel and Melio went out to their site every night atmidnight, making the half-hour walk and crawl through the corridor mazewhich they had rigged with blue glow-globes.There, sitting under hundreds of thousands of tons of stone, they wouldwatch their instruments until morning, listening to their earphones pingwith the sound of particles born in the belly of dying stars.The time tides had not been a problem with the Sphinx. Of all theTombs, it seemed the least protected by the anti-entropic fields and thephysicists had carefully mapped the times when the tide surges mightpose a threat. High tide was at 1000 hours, receding only twentyminutes later back toward the Jade Tomb half a kilometer to the south.Tourists were not allowed near the Sphinx until after 1200 hours, and toleave a margin of safety, the site made sure they were out by 0900. Thephysics team had planted chronotropic sensors at various points alongthe paths and walkways between the Tombs, both to alert the monitors tovariations of the tides and to warn the visitors.With only three weeks to go of her year of research on Hyperion, Rachelawoke one night, left her sleeping lover, and took a ground effect jeepfrom the camp to the Tombs. She and Melio had decided that it wasfoolish for both of them to monitor the equipment every night; now theyalternated, one working at the site while the other collated data andprepared for the final project - a radarmapping of the dunes between the Jade Tomb and the Obelisk.The night was cool and beautiful. A profusion of stars stretched fromhorizon to horizon, four or five times the number Rachel had grown uplooking at from Barnard's World. The low dunes whispered and shifted inthe strong breeze blowing from the mountains in the south.Rachel found lights still burning at the site. The physics team wasjust calling it a day loading their own jeep.She chatted with them, had a cup of coffee as they drove away, and thentook her backpack and made the twenty-five-minute trip into the basementof the Sphinx.For the hundredth time Rachel wondered who had built the Tombs and forwhat purpose. Dating of the construction materials had been uselessbecause of the effect of the anti-entropic field. Only analysis of theTombs in relation to the erosion of the canyon and other surroundinggeological features had suggested an age of at least half a millionyears. The feeling was that the architects of the Time Tombs had beenhumanoid, even though nothing but the gross scale of the structuressuggested such a thing. Certainly the passageways in the Sphinxrevealed little: some were human enough in size and shape, but thenmeters farther along the same corridor might dwindle to a tube the sizeof a sewer pipe and then transform itself into something larger and morerandom than a natural cavern. Doorways, if they could be called suchsince they opened to nothing in particular, might be triangular ortrapezoidal or ten-sided as commonly as rectangular.Rachel crawled the last twenty meters down a steep slope, sliding herbackpack ahead of her. The heatless glow-globes gave the rock and herflesh a bluish, bloodless cast. The 'basement,' when she reached it,seemed a haven of human clutter and smells. Several folding chairsfilled the center of the small space while detectors, oscilloscopes, andother paraphernalia lined the narrow table against the north wall. Aplank on sawhorses along the opposite wall held coffee cups, a chessset, a half-eaten doughnut, two paperbacks, and a plastic toy of somesort of dog in a grass skirt.Rachel settled in, set her coffee therm next to the toy, and checked thecosmic ray detectors. The data appeared to be the same: no hidden roomsor passages, just a few niches even the deep radar had missed. In themorning Melio and Stefan would set a deep probe working, getting animager filament in and sampling the air before digging further with amicro-manipulator. So far a dozen such niches had turned up nothing ofinterest. The joke at camp was that the next hole, no bigger than afist, would reveal miniature sarcophagi, undersized urns, a petitemummy, or- as Melio put it- 'a teeny-tiny Tutankhamen."Out of habit, Rachel tried the comm links on her comlog. Nothing. Fortymeters of stone tended to do that. They had talked of stringingtelephone wire from the basement to the surface, but there had been nopressing need and now their time was almost up. Rachel adjusted theinput channels on her cornlog to monitor the detector data and thensettled back for a long, boring night.There. was the wonderful story of the Old Earth pharaoh- was itCheops?- who authorized his huge pyramid, agreed to the burial chamberbeing deep under the center of the thing, and then lay awake nights foryears in a claustrophobic panic, thinking of all those tons of stoneabove him for all eternity. Eventually the pharaoh ordered the burialchamber repositioned two thirds the way up the great pyramid. Mostunorthodox.Rachel could understand the king's position. She hoped that - whereverhe was - he slept better now.Rachel was almost dozing herself when - at 0215 -her comlog chirped, thedetectors screamed, and she jumped to her feet. According to thesensors, the Sphinx had suddenly grown a dozen new chambers, some largerthan the total structure. Rachel keyed displays and the air misted withmodels that changed as she watched.Corridor schematics twisted back on themselves like rotating MObiusstrips. The external sensors indicated the upper structure twisting andbending like polyfiex in the wind - or like wings.Rachel knew that it was some type of multiple malfunction, but even asshe tried to recalibrate she called data and impressions into hercomlog. Then several things happened at once.She heard the drag of feet in the corridor above her.All of the displays went dead simultaneously.Somewhere in the maze of corridors a time-tide alarm began to blare.All of the lights went off.This final event made no sense. The instrument packages held their ownpower supplies and would have stayed lit through a nuclear attack. Thelamp they used in the basement had a new ten-year power cell. Theglow-globes in the corridors were bioluminescent and needed no power.Nonetheless, the lights were out. Rachel pulled a flashlight laser outof the knee pocket of her jumpsuit and triggered it. Nothing happened.For the first time in her life, terror closed on Rachel Weintraub like ahand on her heart. She could not breathe. For ten seconds she willedherself to be absolutely still, not even listening, merely waiting forthe panic to recede. When it had subsided enough for her to breathewithout gasping, she felt her way to the instruments and keyed them.They did not respond. She lifted her comlog and thumbed the diskey.Nothing... which was impossible, of course, given the solid-stateinvul-nerability and power-cell reliability of the thing. Still,nothing.Rachel could hear her pulse pounding now but she again fought back thepanic and began feeling her way toward the only exit. The thought offinding her way through the maze in absolute darkness made her want toscream but she could think of no other alternatives.Wait. There had been old lights throughout the Sphinx maze but theresearch team had strung the glow-globes.Strung them. There was a perIon line connecting them all the way to thesurface.Fine. Rachel groped her way toward the exit, feeling the cold stoneunder her fingers. Was it this cold before?There came the clear sound of something sharp scraping its way down theaccess shaft.'Melio?" called Rachel into the blackness. 'Tanya?Kurt?"The scraping sounded very close. Rachel backed away, knocking over aninstrument and chair in the blackness. Something touched her hair andshe gasped, raised her hand.The ceiling was lower. The solid block of stone, five meters square,slid lower even as she raised her other hand to touch it. The openingto the corridor was halfway up the wall. Rachel staggered toward it,swinging her hands in front of her like a blind person. She trippedover a folding chair, found the instrument table, followed it to the farwall, felt the bottom of the corridor shaft disappearing as the ceilingcame lower. She pulled back her fingers a second before they weresliced off.Rachel sat down in the darkness. An oscilloscope scraped against theceiling until the table cracked and collapsed under it. Rachel movedher head in short, desperate arcs. There was a metallic rasp - almost abreathing sound - less than a meter from her. She began to back away,sliding across a floor suddenly filled with broken equipment. Thebreathing grew louder.Something sharp and infinitely cold grasped her wrist.Rachel screamed at last.There was no fatline transmitter on Hyperion in those days. Nor did thespinship HS Farraux City have FTL-comm capability. So the first Sol andSarai heard of their daughter's accident was when the Hegemony consulateon Parvati fatlined the college that Rachel had been injured, that shewas stable but unconscious, and that she was being transferred fromParvati to the Web world of Renaissance Vector via medical torchship.The trip would take a little over ten days' shiptime with a five-monthtime-debt. Those five months were agony for Sol and his wife, and bythe time the medical ship put in at the Renaissance farcaster nexus,they had imagined the worst a thousand times. It had been eight yearssince they had last seen Rachel.The Med Center in DaVinci was a floating tower sustained by directbroadcast power. The view over theComo Sea was breathtaking but neither Sol nor Sarai had time for it asthey went from level to level in search of their daughter. Dr Singh andMelio Arundez met them in thehub of Intensive Care. Introductions were rushed.'Rachel?" asked Sarai.'Asleep,' said Dr Singh. She was a tall woman, aristocratic but withkind eyes. 'As far as we can tell, Rachel has suffered no physical...ah... injury. But she has been unconscious now for some seventeenstandardweeks, her time. Only in the past ten days have her brain wavesregistered deep sleep rather than coma."' I don't understand,' said Sol."Was there an accident at the site? Aconcussion?"'Something happened,' said Melio Arundez, 'but we're not sure what.Rachel was in one of the artifacts... alone  . . her comlog andother instruments recorded nothing out of the ordinary. But there was asurge in a phenomenon there known as anti-entropic fields..."'The time tides,' said Sol. 'We know about them.Go on. 'Arundez nodded and opened his hands as if molding air. 'There was a...field surge... more like a tsunami than a tide... the Sphinx... theartifact Rachel was in  . . was totally inundated. I mean, there wasnophysical damage but Rachel was unconscious when we found her  . ."He turned to Dr Singh for help.'Your daughter was in a coma,' said the doctor. 'It was not possible toput her into cryogenic fugue in that condition..."'So she came through quantum leap without fugue?" demanded Sol. He hadread about the psychological damage to travelers who had experienced theHawking effect directly.'No, no,' soothed Singh. 'She was unconscious in a waywhich shielded her quite as well as fugue state."'Is she hurt?" demanded Sarai.'We don't know,' said Singh 'All life signs have returned to nearnormal. Brain-wave activity is nearing a conscious state. The problemis that her body appears to have absorbed... that is, the anti-entropicfield appears to have contaminated her."Sol rubbed his forehead. 'Like radiation sickness?" Dr Singh hesitated.'Not precisely... ah... this case is quite unprecedented. Specialistsin aging diseases are due in this afternoon from Tau Ceti Center, Lusus,and Metaxas."Sol met the woman's gaze. 'Doctor, are you saying that Rachelcontracted some aging disease on Hyperion?" He paused a second to searchhis memory. 'Something like Methuselah syndrome or early Alzheimer'sdisease?"'No,' said Singh, 'in fact your daughter's illness has no name. Themedics here are calling it Merlin's sickness.You see . . . your daughter is aging at a normal rate ... but as faras we can tell, she is aging backward."Sarai pulled away from the group and stared at Singh as if the doctorwere insane. 'I want to see my daughter,'she said, quietly but very firmly. 'I want to see RacheltO W. 'Rachel awakened less than forty hours after Sol and Saral arrived.Within minutes she was sitting up in bed, talking even while the medicsand technicians bustled around her. 'Morn! Dad! What are you doinghere?" Before either could answer, she looked around her and blinked.'Wait a minute, where's here? Are we in Keats?"Her mother took her hand. 'We're in a hospital in DaVinci, dear. OnRenaissance Vector."Rachel's eyes widened almost comically. 'Renaissance.We're in the Web?" She looked around her in total bewilderment.'Rachel, what is the last thing you remember?" asked Dr Singh.The young woman looked uncomprehendingly at the medic. 'The last thingI... I remember going to sleep next to Melio after..." She glanced ather parents and touched her cheeks with the tips of her fingers. 'Melio?The others? Are they..."'Everyone on the expedition is all right,' soothed Dr Singh. 'You had aslight accident. About seventeen weeks have passed. You're back in theWeb. Safe. Everyone in your party is all right."'Seventeen weeks..." Under the fading remnant of her tan, Rachel wentvery pale.Sol took her hand. 'How do you feel, kiddo?" The return pressure on hisfingers was heartbreakingly weak.'I don't know, Daddy,' she managed. 'Tired. Dizzy.Confused."Sarai sat on the bed and put her arms around her. 'It's all fight,baby. Everything's going to be all right."Melio entered the room, unshaven, his hair rumpled from the nap he hadbeen taking in the outer lounge.'Rache?"Rachel looked at him from the safety of her mother's arm. 'Hi,' shesaid, almost shyly. 'l'm back."SoI's opinion had been and continued to be that medicine hadn't reallychanged much since the days of leeches and poultices; nowadays theywhirred one in centrifuges, realigned the body's magnetic field;bombarded the victim with sonic waves, tapped into the cells tointerrogate the RNA, and then admitted their ignorance without actuallycoming out and saying so. The only thing that had changed was that thebills were bigger.He was dozing in a chair when Rachel's voice awoke him.'Daddy?"He sat up, reached for her hand. 'Here, kiddo." 'Where am I, Dad?What's happened?"'You're in a hospital on Renaissance, baby. There was an accident onHyperion. You're all right now except it's affecting your memory abit."Rachel clung to his hand. 'A hospital? In the Web?How'd Iget here? How long have I been here?"'About five weeks,' whispered Sol. 'What's the last thing you remember,Rachel?"She sat back on her pillows and touched her forehead, feeling the tinysensors there. 'Melio and I had been at the meeting. Talking with theteam about setting up the search equipment in the Sphinx. Oh ... Dad... 1 haven't told you about Melio... he's..."'Yes,' said Sol and handed Rachel her comiog. 'Here, kiddo. Listen tothis." He left the room.Rachel touched the diskey and blinked as her own voice began talking toher. 'OK, Rache, you just woke up. You're confused. You don't knowhow you got here.Well, something's happened to you, kid. Listen up.'I'm recording this on the twelfth day of Tenmonth, year 457 of theHegira, A.D. 2739 old reckoning. Yes, I know that's half a standardyear from the last thing you remember. Listen.'Something happened in the Sphinx. You got caught up in the time tide.It changed you. You're aging backward, as dumb as that sounds. Yourbody's getting younger every minute, although that's not the importantpart right now. When you sleep... when we sleep...you forget. You lose another day from your memory before the accident,and you lose everything since. Don't ask me why. The doctors don'tknow. The experts don't know. If you want an analogy, just think of atapeworm virus... one of the old kind... that's chewing up the data inyour comlog... backward from the last entry.'They don't know why the memory loss hits you when you sleep, either.They tried stay-awakes, but after about thirty hours you just gocatatonic for a while and the virus does its thing anyway. So what thehell.'You know something? This talking about yourself in the third person issort of therapeutic. Actually, I'm lying here waiting for them to takeme up to imaging, knowing I'll fall asleep when I get back... knowingVII forget everything again . . . and it scares the shit out of me.'OK, key the diskey for short-term and you get a prepared spiel herethat should catch you up on everything since the accident. Oh... Momand Dad are both here and they know about Melio. But/don't know as muchas I used to. When did we first make love with him, mmm?The second month on Hyperion? Then we have just a few weeks left,Rachel, and then we'll be just acquain tances. Enjoy your memorieswhile you can, girl.'This is yesterday's Rachel, signing off."Sol came in to find his daughter sitting upright in the bed, stillgrasping the comlog tightly, her face pale and terrified. 'Daddy..."He went to sit next to her and let her cry... for the twentieth nightin a row.Eight standard weeks after she arrived on Renaissance, Sol and Saraiwaved goodbye to Rachel and Melio at the Da Vinci farcaster multiportand then farcast home to Barnard's World.'l don't think she should have left the hospital,' muttered Sarai asthey took the evening shuttle to Crawford.The continent was a patchwork of harvest-ready right angles below them.'Mother,' said Sol, touching her knee, 'the doctors would have kept herthere forever. But they're doing it for their own curiosity now.They've done everything they can to help her... nothing. She has alife to live."'But why go away with... with him?" said Sarai. 'She barely knowshim."Sol sighed andJeaned back against the cushions of his seat. 'In twoweeks she won't remember him at all,' he said. 'At least in the waythey share now. Look at it from her position, Mother. Fighting everyday to reorient herself in a world gone mad. She's twenty-five yearsold and in love. Let her be happy."Sarai turned her face to the window and together, not speaking, theywatched the red sun hang like a tethered balloon on the edge of evening.Sol was well into the second semester when Rachel called. It was aone-way message via farcaster cable from Freeholm and her image hung inthe center of the old holopit like a familiar ghost.'Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad. Sorry I haven't written or called the past fewweeks. I guess you know that i've left the university. And Melio. Itwas dumb to try to take new graduate-level stuff. I'd just forgetTuesday whatever was discussed Monday. Even with disks and comlogprompts it was a losing battle. I may enroll in the undergraduateprogram again . . . I remember all of it! Just kidding.'It was just too hard with Melio, too. Or so my notes tell me. Itwasn't his fault, I'm sure of that. He wasgentle and patient and loving to the end. It's just that..well, you can't start from scratch on a relationship every day. Ourapartment was filled with photos of us, notes 1 wrote to myself aboutus, holos of us on Hyperion, but . . you know. In the morning hewould be an absolute stranger. By afternoon I began to believe whatwe'd had, even if I couldn't remember. By evening I'd be crying in hisarms... then, sooner or later, I'd go to sleep. It's better this way."Rachel's image paused, turned as if she was going to break contact, andthen steadied. She smiled at them.'So anyway, I've left school for a while. The Freeholm Med Center wantsme full time but they'd have to get in line... I got an offer from theTau Ceti Research Institute that's hard to turn down. They offer a... Ithink they call it a "research honorarium" . . . that's bigger thanwhat we paid for four years at Nightenhelser and all of Reichs combined.'I turned them down. I'm still going in as an outpatient, but the RNAtransplant series just leaves me with bruises and a depressed feeling.Of course, I could just be depressed because every morning I can'tremember where the bruises came from. Ha-ha.'Anyway, 1'11 be staying with Tanya for a while and then maybe... Ithought maybe I'd come home for a while. Secondmonth's my birthday...I'll be twenty-two again. Weird, huh? At any rate, it's a lot easierbeing around people I know and I met Tanya just after I transferred herewhen I was twenty-two ... I think you understand.'So... is my old room still here, Mom, or have you turned it into amah-jongg parlor like you've always threatened? So write or give me acall. Next time l'll shell out the money for two-way so we can reallytalk. I just  . . 1 guess I thought..."Rachel waved. 'Gottago. See you later, alligators. I love you both."Sol flew to Bussard City the week before Rachel's birthday to pick herup at the world's only public farcaster terminex. He saw her first,standing with her luggagenear the floral clock. She looked young but not noticeably younger thanwhen they had waved goodbye on Renaissance Vector. No, Sol realized,there was something less confident about her posture. He shook his headto rid himself of such thoughts, called to her, and ran to hug her.The look of shock on her face when he released her was so profound thathe could not ignore it. 'What is it, sweetie? What's wrong?"It was one of the few times he had ever seen his daughter totally at aloss for words.'I... you... I forgot,' she stammered. She shook her head in afamiliar way and managed to laugh and cry at the same instant. 'Youlook a little different is all, Dad. I remember leaving here like itwas... literally... yesterday.When I saw... your hair..." Rachel covered her mouth.Sol ran his hand across his scalp. 'Ah, yes,' he said, suddenly closeto laughing and crying himself. 'With your school and travels, it'sbeen more than eleven years. I'm old. And bald." He opened his armsagain. 'Welcome back, little one."Rachel moved into the protective circle of his embrace.For several months things went well. Rachel felt more secure withfamiliar things around, and for Sarai the heartbreak of their daughter'sillness was temporarily offset by the pleasure of having her home again.Rachel rose early every morning and viewed her private 'orientationshow' which, Sol knew, contained images of him and Sarai a dozen yearsolder than she remembered.He tried to imagine what it was like for Rachel: she awoke in her ownbed, memory fresh, twenty-two years old, home on vacation before goingoffworld to graduate school, only to find her parents suddenly aged, ahundred small changes in the house and town, the news different  . .years of history having passed her by.Sol could not imagine it.Their first mistake was acceding to Rachel's wishes in inviting her oldfriends to her twenty-second birthday party: the same crew who hadcelebrated the firsttime- irrepressible Niki, Don Stewart and his friend Howard, Kathi Obegand Marta Tyn, her best friend Linna McKyler - all of them then just outof college, shucking off cocoons of childhood for new lives.Rachel had seen them all since her return. But she had slept... andforgotten. And Sol and Sarai this one time did not remember that shehad forgotten.Niki was thirty-four standard, with two children of her own - stillenergetic, still irrepressible, but ancient by Rachel's standards. Donand Howard talked about their investments, their children's sportsaccomplishments, and their upcoming vacations. Kathi was confused,speaking only twice to Rachel and then as if she was speaking to animpostor. Marta was openly jealous of Rachel's youth. Linna, who hadbecome an ardent Zen Gnostic in the years between, cried and left early.When they had gone, Rachel sat in the postparty ruin of the living roomand stared at the half-eaten cake. She did not cry. Before goingupstairs she hugged her mother and whispered to her father, 'Dad, pleasedon't let me do anything like that again."Then she went upstairs to sleep.It was that spring when Sol again had the dream. He was lost in agreat, dark place, lighted only by two red orbs. It was not absurd whenthe flat voice said:'Sol. Take your daughter, your only Rachel, whom you love, and go tothe world called Hyperion and offer her there as a burnt offering at oneof the places of which I shall tell you."And Sol had screamed into the darkness:'You already have her, you son of a bitch! What do I have to do to gether back? Tell me! Tell me, goddamn you!'And Sol Weintraub woke sweating with tears in his eyes and anger in hisheart. In the other room he could feel his daughter sleeping while thegreat worm devoured her.In the months which followed Sol became obsessive about obtaininginformation on Hyperion, the Time Tombs, and the Shrike. As a trainedresearcher, he was astounded that there were so little hard data on soprovocative a topic. There was the Church of the Shrike, of course -there were no temples on Barnard's World but many in the Web - but hesoon found that seeking hard information in Shrike cult literature waslike trying to map the geography of Sarnath by visiting a Buddhistmonastery. Time was mentioned in Shrike Church dogma, but only in thesense that the Shrike was supposed to be '... the Angel of Retributionfrom Beyond Time' and that true time had ended for the human race whenOld Earth died and that the four centuries since had been 'false time."Sol found their tracts the usual combination of double talk and navellint-gathering common to most religions. Still, he planned to visit aShrike Church temple as soon as he had explored more serious avenues ofresearch.Melio Arundez launched another Hyperion expedition, also sponsored byReichs University, this one with the stated goal of isolating andunderstanding the time-tide phenomenon which had inflicted the Merlinsickness on Rachel. A major development was the Hegemony Protectorate'sdecision to send along on that expedition a fatline transmitter forinstallation at the Hegemony consulate in Keats. Even so, it would bemore than three years' Web time before the expedition arrived onHyperion. SoI's first instinct was to go with Arundez and his team -certainly any holodrama would have the primary characters returning tothe scene of the action. But Sol overrode the instinctive urge withinminutes. He was a historian and philosopher; any contribution he mightmake to the expedition's success would be minute, at best. Rachel stillretained the interest and skills of a we!l-trained undergraduatearchaeologist-to-be, but those skills dwindled a bit each day and Solcould see no benefit to her returning to the site of the accident. Eachday would be a shock to her, awakening on a strange world, on a missionwhich would require skills unknown to her.Sarai would not allow such a thing.Sol set aside the book he was working on - an analysis of Kierkegaard'stheories of ethics as compromise morality as applied to the legalmachinery of the Hegemony - and concentrated on collecting arcane dataon time, on Hyperion, and on the story of Abraham.Months spent carrying on business as usual and collecting informationdid little to satisfy his need for action. Occasionally he vented hisfrustration on the medical and scientific specialists who came toexamine Rachel like streams of pilgrims to a holy shrine.'How the hell can this be happening!" he screamed at one littlespecialist who had made the mistake of being both smug and condescendingto the patient's father.The doctor had a head so hairless, his face looked like lines painted ona billiard ball. 'She's begun growing smaller!" Sol shouted, literallybuttonholing the retreating expert. 'Not so one can see, but bone massis decreasing. How can she even begin to become a child again? Whatthe hell does that do to the law of conservation of mass?"The expert had moved his mouth but had been too rattled to speak. Hisbearded colleague answered for him. 'M. Weintranb,' he said, 'sir. Youhave to understand that your daughter is currently inhabiting... ah ..think of it as a localized region of reversed entropy."Sol wheeled on the other man. 'Are you saying that she is merely stuckin a bubble of backwardness?"'Ah... no,' said the colleague, massaging his chin nervously. 'Perhapsa better analogy is that ...biologically at least... the life/metabolism mechanism has beenreversed... ah..."'Nonsense,' snapped Sol. 'She doesn't excrete for nutrition orregurgitate her food. And what about all the neurological activity?Reverse'the electrochemical impulses and you get nonsense. Her brainworks, gentlemen ... it's her memory that is disappearing. Why,gentlemen? Why?"The specialist finally found his voice. 'We don't know why, M.Weintraub. Mathematically, your daughter's body resembles atime-reversed equation... or perhaps an object which has passed througha rapidly spinningblack hole We don't know how this has happened or why the physicallyimpossible is occurring in this instance, M. Weintraub. We just don'tknow enough."Sol shook each man's hand. 'Fine. That's all I wanted to know,gentlemen. Have a good trip back." +On Rachel's twenty-first birthday she came to Sol's door an hour afterthey had all turned in. 'Daddy?"'What is it, kiddo?" Sol pulled on his robe and joined her in thedoorway. 'Can't sleep?"'I haven't slept for two days,' she whispered. 'Been taking stay-awakesso 1 can get through all of the brief ing stuff I left in the WantaKnow? file."Sol nodded.'Daddy, would you come downstairs and have a drink with me? I've gotsome things I want to talk about."Sol got his glasses from the nightstand and joined her downstairs.It proved to be the first and only time that Sol would get drunk withhis daughter. It was not a boisterous drunk- for a while they chatted,then began telling jokes and making puns, until each was giggling toohard to continue. Rachel started to tell another story, sipped herdrink just at the funniest part, and almost snorted whiskey out hernose, she was laughing so hard. Each of them thought it was thefunniest thing that had ever happened.'I'll get another bottle,' said Sol when the tears had ceased. 'DeanMoore gave me some Scotch last Christmas...I think."When he returned, walking carefully, Rachel had sat up on the couch andbrushed her hair with her fingers.He poured her a small amount and the two drank insilence for a while.'Daddy?" 'Yes?"'I went through the whole thing. Saw myself, listened to myself, sawthe holos of Linna and the others all middle-aged..."'Hardly middle-aged,' said Sol. 'Liana will be thirty-five nextmonth..."'Well, old, you know what ! mean, Anyway, I read the medical briefs,saw the photos from Hyperion, andyou know what?"'What?"'I don't believe any of it, Dad."Sol put down his drink and looked at his daughter.Her face was fuller than before, less sophisticated. And even morebeautiful.'1 mean, I do believe it,' she said with a small, scared laugh. 'It'snot like you and Mom would put on such a cruel joke. Plus there'syour... your age... and the news and all. I know it's real, but Idon't believe it. Doyou know what I mean, Dad?"'Yes,' said Sol.'I mean I woke up this morning and I thought, Great . . . tomorrow'sthe paleontology exam and l've hardly studied. I was looking forward toshowing Roger Sherman a thing or two... he thinks he's so smart."Sol took a drink. 'Roger died three years ago in a plane crash south ofBussard,' he said. He would not have spoken without the whiskey in him,but he had to find out if there was a Rachel hiding within the Rachel.'I know,' said Rachel and pulled her knees up to her chin. '1 accessedeverybody I knew. Gram's dead. Professor Eikhardt isn't teachinganymore. Niki married some... salesman. A lot happens in four years."'More than eleven years,' said Sol. 'The trip to and from Hyperion leftyou six years behind us stay-at-homes."'But that's normal,' cried Rachel. 'People travel outside the Web allthe time. They cope."Sol nodded. 'But this is different, kiddo."Rachel managed a smile and drained the last of her whiskey. 'Boy, whatan understatement." She set the glass down with a sharp, final sound.'Look, here's what l've decided. I've spent two and a half days goingthrough all of the stuff she... !... prepared to let me know what'shappened, what's going on... and #just doesn't help."Sol sat perfectly still, not even daring to breathe.'I mean,' said Rachel, 'knowing that I'm gettingyounger every day, losing the memory of people 1 haven't even met yet...I mean, what happens next? 1 just keep getting younger and smaller andless capable until I just disappear someday? Jesus, Dad." Rachelwrapped her arms more tightly around her knees. 'It'ssort of funny in a weird way, isn't it?"'No,' Sol said quietly.'No, I'm sure it's not,' said Rachel. Her eyes, always large and dark,were moist. 'It must be the worst nightmare in the world for you andMorn. Every day you have to watch me come down the stairs . . .confused . . .waking up with yesterday's memories but hearing my own voice tell methat yesterday was years ago. That Ihad a love affair with some guy named Areclio..." 'Melio,' whisperedSol.'Whatever. It just doesn't help, Dad. By the time I can even begin toabsorb it, I'm so worn out that I have to sleep. Then... well, youknow what happens then."'What ..." began Sol and had to clear his throat.'What do you want us to do, little one?"Rachel looked him in the eye and smiled. It was the same smile she hadgifted him with since her fifth week of life. 'Don't tell me, Dad,' shesaid firmly. 'Don't let me tell me. It just hurts. I mean, I didn'tlive those times' She paused and touched her forehead. 'You know vit I mean, Dad. TheRachel who went to another planet and fell in love and got hurt ... thatwas a different Rachel! I shouldn't have to suffer her pain." She wascrying now. 'Do you understand? Do you?"'Yes,' said Sol. He opened his arms and felt her warmth and tearsagainst his chest. 'Yes, I understand."Fatline messages from Hyperion came frequently the next year but theywere all negative. The nature and source of the anti-entropic fieldshad not been found.No unusual time-tide activity had been measured around the Sphinx.Experiments with laboratory animals in and around the tidal regions hadresulted in sudden death for some animals, but the Merlin sickness hadnot been replicated. Melio ended every message with 'My love toRachel."Sol and Sarai used money loaned from Reichs University to receivelimited Poulsen treatments in Bussard City. They were already too oldfor the process to extend their lives for another century, but itrestored the look of a couple approaching fifty standard rather thanseventy.They studied old family photos and found that it was not too difficultto dress the way they had a decade and a half before.Sixteen-year-old Rachel tripped down the stairs with her comlog tuned tothe college radio station. 'Can I have rice cereal?"'Don't you have it every morning?" smiled Sarai.'Yes,' grinned Rachel. 'I just thought we might be outor something. I heard the phone. Was that Niki?" 'No,' said Sol.'Damn,' said Rachel and glanced at them. 'Sorry. But she promisedshe'd call as soon as the standardized scores came in. Three weekssince tutorials. You'd think l'd have heard something."'Don't worry,' said Sarai. She brought the coffeepot to the table,started to pour Rachel a cup, poured it for herself. 'Don't worry,honey. I promise you that your scores will be good enough to get youinto any school you want."'More,' sighed Rachel. 'You don't know. It's a dog-eat-dog world outthere." She frowned. 'Have you seen my math ansible? My room was allmessed around. I couldn't find anything."Sol cleared his throat. 'No classes today, kiddo."Rachel stared. 'No classes? On a Tuesday? Six weeks from graduation?What's up?"''You've been sick,' Sarai said firmly. 'You can stay home one day. Justtoday."Rachel's frown deepened. 'Sick? I don't feel sick. Just sort ofweird. Like things aren't... aren't right somehow.Like why's the couch moved around in the media room? And where's Chips?I called and called but he didn't come."Sol touched his daughter's wrist. 'You've been sick for a while,' hesaid. 'The doctor said you might wakeup with a few gaps. Let's talk while we walk over to the campus. Wantto?"Rachel brightened. 'Skip classes and go to the college?Sure." She faked a look of consternation. 'As long as we don't run intoRoger Sherman. He's taking freshman calculus up there and he's such apain."'We won't see Roger,' said Sol. 'Ready to go?"'Almost." Rachel leaned over and gave her mother a huge hug. ' 'Lateralligator."' 'While, crocodile,' said Sarai.'Okay,' grinned Rachel, her long hair bouncing. 'l'm ready."The constant trips to Bussard City had required the purchase of an EMVand on a cool day in autumn Sol took the slowest route, far below thetraffic lanes, enjoying the sight and smell of the harvested fieldsbelow. More than a few men and women working in the fields waved tohim.Bussard had grown impressively since Sol's childhood, but the synagoguewas still there on the edge of one of the oldest neighborhoods in thecity. The temple was old, Sol felt old, even the yarmulke he put on ashe entered seemed ancient, worn thin by decades of use, but the rabbiwas young. Sol realized that the man was at least forty - his hair wasthinning on either side of the dark skullcap - but to Sol's eyes he waslittle more than a boy. Sol was relieved when the younger man suggestedthat they finish their conversation in the park across the street.They sat on a park bench. Sol was surprised to find himself stillcarrying the yarmulke, passing the cloth from hand to hand. The daysmelled of burning leaves and the previous night's rain.'1 don't quite understand, M. Weintraub,' said the rabbi. 'Is it thedream you're disturbed about or the fact that your daughter has becomeill since you began the dream?"Sol raised his head to feel the sunlight on his face.'Neither, exactly,' he said. '1 just can't help but feel that the twoare connected somehow."The rabbi ran a finger over his lower lip. 'How old is your daughter?"'Thirteen,' said Sol after an imperceptible pause.'And is the illness... serious? Life threatening?" 'Not lifethreatening,' said Sol. 'Not yet."The rabbi folded his arms across an ample belly. 'Youdon't believe... may I call you Sol?"'Of course."'Sol, you don't believe that by having this dream...that somehow you've caused your little girl's illness.Do you?"'No,' said Sol and sat a moment, wondering deep within if he was tellingthe truth. 'No, Rabbi, I don't think..."'Call me Mort, Sol."'All right, Mort. I didn't come because I believe that I - or the dream- am causing Rachel's illness. But I believe my subconscious might betrying to tell me something."Mort rocked back and forth slightly. 'Perhaps a neuro-specialist orpsychologist could help you more there, Sol. I'm not sure what I..."'I'm interested in the story of Abraham,' interrupted Sol. 'I mean,I've had some experience with different ethical systems, but it's hardfor me to understand one which began with the order to a father to slayhis son."'No, no, no!" cried the rabbi, waving oddly childlike fingers in frontof him. 'When the time came, God stayed Abraham's hand. He would nothave allowed a human sacrifice in His name. It was the obedience to thewill of the Lord that..."'Yes,' said Sol. 'Obedience. But it says, "Then Abraham put forth hishand, and took the knife to slay his son." God must have looked into hissoul and seen that Abraham was ready to slay Isaac. A mere show ofobedience without inner commitment would not have appeased the God ofGenesis. What would have happened if Abraham had loved his son morethan he loved .God?"Mort drummed his fingers on his knee a moment and then reached out tograsp So!'s upper arm. 'Sol, I can seeyou're upset about your daughter's illness. Don't get it mixed up witha document written eight thousand years ago. Tell me more about yourlittle girl. I mean, children don't die of diseases anymore. Not inthe Web."Sol rose, smiled, and stepped back to free his arm. 'I'd like to talkmore, Mort. I want to. But I have to get back.I have a class this evening."'Will you come to temple this Sabbath?" asked the rabbi, extendingstubby fingers for a final human contact.Sol dropped the yarmulke into the younger man's hands. 'Perhaps one ofthese days, Mort. One of these days I will."Later the same autumn Sol looked out the window of his study to see thedark figure of a man standing under the bare elm in front of the house.The media, thought Sol, his heart sinking. For a decade he had beendreading the day the secret got out, knowing it would mean the end oftheir simple life in Crawford. He walked out into the evening chill.'Melio!" he said when he saw the tall man's face.The archaeologist stood with his hands in the pockets of his long bluecoat. Despite the ten standard years since their last contact, Arundezhad aged but little -Sol guessed that he was still in his late twenties.But the younger man's heavily tanned face was lined with worry. 'Sol,'he said and extended his hand almost shyly.Sol shook his hand warmly. 'I didn't know you were back. Come into thehouse."'No." The archaeologist took a half step back. 'I've been out here foran hour, Sol. I didn't have the courage to come to the door."Sol started to speak but then merely nodded. He put his hands in hisown pockets against the chill. The first stars were becoming visibleabove the dark gables of the house. 'Rachel's not home right now,' hesaid at last.'She went to the library. She . . . she thinks she has a historypaper due."Melio took a ragged breath and nodded in return.'Sol,' he said, his voice thick, 'you and Sarai need to understand thatwe did everything we could. The team was on Hyperion for almost threestandard years. We would have stayed if the university hadn't cut ourfunds.There was nothing..."'We know,' said Sol. 'We appreciated the fatline messages."'I spent months alone in the Sphinx myself,' said Melio. 'According tothe instruments, it was just an inert pile of stones, but sometimes Ithought I felt... something .... ' He shook his head again. 'I failedher, Sol."'No,' said Sol and gripped the younger man's shoulder through the woolcoat. 'But I have a question. We've been in touch with our senators...even talked to the Science Council directors; . . but no one canexplain to me why the Hegemony hasn't spent more time and moneyinvestigating the phenomena on Hyperion. It seems to me that theyshould have invested that world into the Web long ago, if only for itsscientific potential.How can they ignore an enigma like the Tombs?"'I know what you mean, Sol. Even the early cutoff of our funds wassuspicious. It's as if the Hegemony had a policy to keep Hyperion atarm's length."'Do you think . . ." began Sol but at the moment Rachel approachedthem in the autumn twilight. Her hands were thrust deep in her redjacket, her hair was cut short in the decades-old style of adolescentseverywhere, and her full cheeks were flushed with the cold. Rachel wasteetering on the brink of childhood and young adulthood; her long legsin jeans, sports shoes, and bulky jacket might have been the silhouetteof a boy.,. She grinned at them. 'Hi, Dad." Stepping closer in the dim light,she nodded at Melio shyly. 'Sorry, didn't mean to interrupt yourconversation."Sol took a breath. 'That's all right, kiddo. Rachel, this is DrArundez from Reichs University on Freeholm.Dr Arundez, my daughter Rachel."'Pleased to meet you,' said Rachel, beaming in earnest now. 'Wow,Reichs. I've read their catalogues. I'd love to go there someday."Melio nodded rigidly. Sol could see the stiffness in hisshoulders and torso. 'Do you..." began Melio. 'That is, what would youlike to study there?"Sol thought the pain in the man's voice must be audible to Rachel butshe only shrugged and laughed.'Oh, jeez, everything. Old Mr Eikhardt- he's thepaleontology/archaeology tute in the advanced class I take up at the EdCenter - he says they have a greatclassics and ancient artifacts department."'They do,' managed Melio.Rachel glanced shyly from her father to the stranger, apparently sensingthe tension there but not knowing the source. 'Well, l'm justinterrupting your conversation more here. l've got to get in and get tobed. I guess I've had this strange virus... sort of like meningitis,More says, only it must make me sort of goofy. Anyway, nice to meetyou, Dr Arundez. I hope I'll see you at Reichs someday. ''I hope that too,' said Melio, staring at her so intensely in the gloomthat Sol had the feeling he was trying to memorize everything about theinstant.'Okay, well . . ." said Rachel and stepped back, her rubber-soledshoes squeaking on the sidewalk, 'goodnight, then. See you in the morning, Dad."'Good night, Rachel."She paused at the doorway. The gaslight on the lawn made her look muchyounger than thirteen. ' 'Later, alligators."' 'While, crocodile,' said Sol and heard Melio whisper it in unison.They stood awhile in silence, feeling the night settle on the smalltown. A boy on a bicycle rode by, leaves crackling under his wheels,spokes gleaming in the pools of light under the old streetlamps. 'Comein the house,' Sol said to the silent man. 'Sarai will be very pleasedto see you. Rachel will be asleep."'Not now,' said Melio. He was a shadow there, his hands still in hispockets. '1 need to... it was a mistake, Sol." He started to turnaway, looked back. 'I'!1 phone when I get to Freeholm,' he said. 'We'llget another expedition put together."Sol nodded. Three years transit, he thought. If theyleft tonight she wouM be... not quite ten before they arrive. 'Good,'he said.Melio paused, raised a hand in farewell, and walked away along the curb,ignoring the leaves that crunched underfoot.Sol never saw him in person again.The largest Church of the Shrike in the Web was on Lusus and Sol farcastthere a few weeks before Rachel's tenth birthday. The building itselfwas not much larger than an Old Earth cathedral, but it seemed giganticwith its effect of flying buttresses in search of a church, twistedupper stories, and support walls of stained glass.Sol's mood was low and the brutal Lusian gravity did nothing to lightenit. Despite his appointment with the bishop, Sol had to wait more thanfive hours before he was allowed into the inner sanctum. He spent mostof the time staring at the slowly rotating twenty-meter, steel andpolychrome sculpture which might have been of the legendary Shrike . .. and might have been an abstract homage to every edged weapon everinvented.What interested Sol the most were the two red orbs floating within thenightmare space which might have been a skull.'M. Weintraub?"'Your Excellency,' said Sol. He noticed that the acolytes, exorcists,!ectors, and ostiaries who had kept him company during the long wait hadprostrated themselves on the dark tiles at the high priest's entry. Solmanaged a formal bow.'Please, please, do come in, M. Weintraub,' said the priest. Heindicated the doorway to the Shrike sanctuary with a sweep of his robedarm.Sol passed through, found himself in a dark and echoing place not toodissimilar from the setting of his recurrent dream, and took a seatwhere the bishop indicated. As the cleric moved to his own place atwhat looked like a small throne behind an intricately carved butthoroughly modern desk, Sol noticed that the high priest was a nativeLusian, gone to fat and heavy in the jowls, but formidable in the wayall Lusus residentsseemed to be. His robe was striking in its redness... a bright,arterial red, flowing more like a contained liquid than like silk orvelvet, trimmed in onyx ermine. The bishop wore a large ring on eachfinger and they alternated red and black, producing a disturbing effectin Sol.'Your Excellency,' began Sol, 'I apologize in advance for any breach inchurch protocol which I have committed...or may commit. I confess I.know little about the Church of the Shrike,but what I do know has brought me here. Please forgive me if Iinadvertently display my ignorance by my clumsy use of titles or terms."The bishop wiggled his fingers at Sol. Red and black stones flashed inthe weak light. 'Titles are unimportant, M. Weintraub. Addressing usas "Your Excellency" is quite acceptable for a nonbeliever. We mustadvise you, however, that the formal name of our modest group is theChurch of the Final Atonement and the entity whom the world so blithelycalls... the Shrike... we refer to  . . if we take His name atall... as the Lord of Pain or, more commonly, the Avatar. Pleaseproceed with the important query you said you had for us."Sol bowed slightly. 'Your Excellency, I am a teacher..."'Excuse us for interrupting, M. Weintraub, but you are much more than ateacher. You are a scholar. We are very familiar with your writings onmoral hermeneutics.The reasoning therein is flawed but quite challenging.We use it regularly in our courses in doctrinal apologetics.Please proceed."Sol blinked. His work was almost unknown outside the most rarefiedacademic circles and this recognition had thrown him. In the fiveseconds it took him to recover, Sol found it preferable to believe thatthe Shrike bishop wanted to know with whom he spoke and had an excellentstaff. 'Your Excellency, my background is immaterial. 1 asked to seeyou because my child... my .daughter... has taken ill as a possibleresult of research she was carrying out in an area which is of someimportance to your Church. I speak, of course, of the so-called TimeTombs on the world of Hyperion."The bishop nodded slowly. Sol wondered if he knew about Rachel.'You are aware, M. Weintraub, that the area you referred to . . .what we call the Covenant Arks . . .has recently been declared off limits to so-called researchers by theHome Rule Council of Hyperion?"'Yes, Your Excellency. I have heard that. I understand that yourChurch was instrumental in that legislation being passed."The bishop showed no response to this. Far off in the incense-layeredgloom, small chimes sounded 'At any rate, Your Excellency, I hoped thatsome aspect of your Church's doctrine might shed light on my daughter'sillness."The bishop inclined his head forward so that the single shaft of lightwhich illuminated him gleamed on his forehead and cast his eyes intoshadow. 'Do you wish to receive religious instruction in the mysteriesof the Church, M. Weintraub?"Sol touched his beard with a finger. 'No, Your Excellency, unless in sodoing I might improve the wellbeing of my daughter."'And does your daughter wish to be initiated into the Church of theFinal Atonement?"Sol hesitated a beat. 'Again, Your Excellency, she wishes to be well.If joining the Church would heal or help her, it would be a very seriousconsideration."The bishop sat back in a rustle of robes. Redness seemed to flow fromhim into the gloom. 'You speak of physical wellbeing, M. Weintraub.Our Church is the final arbiter of spiritual salvation. Are you awarethat the former invariably flows from the latter?"'I am aware that this is an old and widely respected proposition,' saidSol. 'The total wellbeing of our daughter is the concern of my wife andmyself."The bishop rested his massive head on his fist. 'What is the nature ofyour daughter's illness, M. Weintraub?" 'It is... a time-relatedillness, Your Excellency."The bishop sat forward, suddenly tense. 'And at which of the holy sitesdid you say your daughter contracted this malady, M. Weintraub?"'The artifact called the Sphinx, Your Excellency." The bishop stood soquickly that papers on his desktop were knocked to the floor. Evenwithout the robes, the man would have massed twice Sol's weight. In thefluttering red robes, stretched to his full height, the Shrike priestnow towered over Sol like crimson death incarnate. 'You can go!"bellowed the big man. 'Your daughter is the most blessed and cursed ofindividuals.There is nothing that you or the Church . . . or any agent in thislife... can do for her."Sol stood . . . or, rather, sat . . . his ground. 'YourExcellency, if there is any possibility..."'NO!" cried the bishop, red in the face now, a consummately consistentapparition. He tapped at his desk.Exorcists and lectors appeared in the doorway, their black robes withred trim an ominous echo of the bishop. The all-black ostiaries blendedwith the shadows.'The audience is at an end,' said the bishop with less volume butinfinite finality. 'Your daughter has been chosen by the Avatar toatone in a way which all sinners and nonbelievers must someday suffer.Someday very soon."'Your Excellency, if I can have just five minutes more of your time..."The bishop snapped his fingers and the exorcists came forward to escortSol out. The men were Lusian. One of them could have handled fivescholars So!'s size.'Your Excellency..." cried Sol after he had shrugged off the first man'shands. The three other exorcists came to assist with the equally brawnylectors hovering nearby. The bishop had turned his back and seemed tobe staring into the darkness.The outer sanctuary echoed to grunts and the scraping of So!'s heels andto at least one loud gasp as Sol's foot made contact with the leastpriestly parts of the lead exorcist. The outcome of the debate was notaffected.Sol landed in the street. The last ostiary to turn away tossed So!'sbattered hat to him.Ten more days on Lusus achieved nothing but more gravity fatigue forSol. The Temple bureaucracy would not answer his calls. The courtscould offer him nowedge. The exorcists waited just within the doors of the vestibule.Sol farcast to New Earth and Renaissance Vector, to Fuji and TC2, toDeneb Drei and Deneb Vier, but everywhere the Shrike temples were closedto him.Exhausted, frustrated, out of money, Sol 'cast home to Barnard's World,got the EMV out of the long-term lot, and arrived home an hour beforeRachel's birthday.'Did you bring me anything, Daddy?" asked the excited ten-year-old.Sarai had told her that day that Sol had been gone.Sol brought out the wrapped package. It was the collected Anne of GreenGables series. It was not whathe had wanted to bring her.'Can I open it?"'Later, little one. With the other things."'Oh, please, Dad. Just one thing now. Before Niki and the other kidsget here?"Sol caught Sarai's eye. She shook her head. Rachel remembered invitingNiki and Linna and her other friends to the party only days before.Sarai had not yet come up with an excuse.'All right, Rachel,' he said. 'Just this one before the party."While Rachel ripped into the small package, Sol saw the giant package inthe living room, secured with red ribbon. The new bike, of course.Rachel had asked for the new bike for a year before her tenth birthday.Sol tiredly wondered if she would be surprised tomorrow to find the newbike here the day before her tenth birthday.Or perhaps they would get rid of the bike that night, while Rachelslept.Sol collapsed onto the couch. The red ribbon reminded him of thebishop's robes.Sarai had never had an easy time of surrendering the past. Every timeshe cleaned and folded and put away a set of Rachel's outgrown babyclothes, she had shed secret tears that Sol somehow knew about. Saraihad treasured every stage of Rachel's childhood, enjoying the day-to-daynormaIcy of things; a normaIcy whichshe quietly accepted as the best of life. She had always felt that theessence of human experience lay not primarily in the peak experiences,the wedding days and triumphs which stood out in the memory like datescircled in red on old calendars, but, rather, in the unsetf-consciousflow of little things - the weekend afternoon with each member of thefamily engaged in his or her own pursuit, their crossings andconnections casual, dialogues imminently forgettable, but the sum ofsuch hours creating a synergy which was important and eternal.Sol found Sarai in the attic, weeping softly as she went through boxes.These were not the gentle tears once shed for the ending of smallthings. Sarai Weintraub was angry.'What are you doing, Mother?"'Rachel needs clothes. Everything is too big. What fit on aneight-year-old won't fit a seven-year-old. I have some more of herthings here somewhere."'Leave it,' said Sol. 'We'll buy something new." Sarai shook her head.'And have her wonder every day where all of her favorite clothes havegone? No. I'vesaved some things. They're here somewhere."'Do it later."'Damn it, there/s no later!" shouted Sarai and then turned away from Soland raised her hands to her face.'I'm sorry."Sol put his arms around her. Despite the limited Poulsen treatments,her bare arms were much thinner than he remembered. Knots and cordsunder rough skin.He hugged her tightly.'l'm sorry,' she repeated, sobbing openly now. 'It's just not fair."'No,' agreed Sol. 'It's not fair." The sunlight coming through thedusty attic panes had a sad, cathedral quality to it. Sol had alwaysloved the smell of an attic - the hot and stale promise of a place sounderused and filled with future treasures. Today it was ruined.He crouched next to a box. 'Come, dear,' he said, 'we'll looktogether."Rachel continued to be happy, involved with life, only slightly confusedby the incongruities which faced her each morning when she awoke. Asshe grew younger it became easier to explain away the changes thatappeared -to have occurred overnight - the old elm out front gone, thenew apartment building on the corner where M.Nesbitt used to live in a colonial-era home, the absence of her friends- and Sol began to see as never before the flexibility of children. Henow imagined Rachel living on the breaking crest of the wave of time,not seeing the murky depths of the sea beyond, keeping her balance withher small store of memories and a total commitment to the twelve tofifteen hours of now allowed her each day.Neither Sol nor Sarai wanted their daughter isolated from other childrenand it was difficult to find ways to make contact. Rachel was delightedto play with the 'new girl' or 'new boy' in the neighborhood - childrenof other instructors, the grandchildren of friends, for a while withNiki's daughter - but the other children had to grow accustomed toRachel greeting them anew each day, remembering nothing of their commonpast, and only a few had the sensitivity to continue such a charade forthe sake of a playmate.The story of Rachel's unique illness was no secret in Crawford, ofcourse. The fact of it had spread through the college the first year ofRachel's return and the entire town knew soon after. Crawford reactedin the fashion of small towns immemorial- some tongues waggedconstantly, some people could not keep the pity and pleasure at someoneelse's misfortune out of their voices and gazes - but mostly thecommunity folded its protective wings around the Weintraub family likean awkward mother bird shielding its young.Still, they were allowed to live their lives, and even when Sol had tocut back classes and then take an early retirement because of tripsseeking medical treatment for Rachel, the real reason was mentioned byno one.But it could not last, of course, and on the spring day when Sol steppedonto the porch and saw his weeping seven-year-old daughter coming backfrom the parksurrounded and followed by a pack of newsteeps, their camera implantsgleaming and cornlogs extended, he knew that a phase of their life wasover forever. Sol jumped from the porch and ran to Racbel's side.'M. Weintraub, is it true that your daughter contracted a terminal timeillness? What's going to happen in seven years? Will she justdisappear?"'M. Weintraub! M. Weintraub! Rachel says that she thinks RabenDowell is Senate CEO and this is the year A.D. 2711. Has she lostthose thirty-four years completely or is this a delusio, caused by theMerlin sickness?"'Rachel! Do you remember being a grown woman?What's it feel like to be a kid again?"'M. Weintraub! M. Weintraub! Just one still image, please. Howabout you get apicture of Rachel when she was older and you and the kidstand looking at it?"'M. Weintraub! Is it true that this is the curse of the Time Tombs?Did Rachel see the Shrike monster?"'Hey, Weintraub! Sol! Hey, Solly! What're you and the little womangoing to do when the kid's gone?"There was a newsteep blocking Sol's way to the front door. The manleaned forward, the stereo lenses of his eyes elongating as they zoomedin for a close-up of Rachel. Sol grabbed the man's long hair - whichwas conveniently tied in a queue - and flung him aside.The pack brayed and bellowed outside the house for seven weeks. Solrealized what he had known and forgotten about very small communities:they were frequently annoying, always parochial, sometimes prying on aone-to-one level, but never had they subscribed to the vicious legacy ofthe so-called 'public's right to know."The Web did. Rather than have his family become permanent prisoners tothe besieging reporters, Sol went on the offensive. He arrangedinterviews on the most pervasive farcaster cable news programs,participated in All Thing discussions, and personally attended theConcourse Medical Research Conclave. In ten standard months he askedfor help for his daughter on eighty worlds.Offers poured in from ten thousand sources but the bulk of thecommunications were from faith healers, project promoters, institutesand free-lance researchers offering their services in exchange for thepublicity, Shrike cultists and other religious zealots pointing out thatRachel deserved the punishment, requests from various advertisingagencies for product endorsements, offers from media agents to 'handle'Rachel for such endorsements, offers of sympathy from common people -frequently enclosing credit chips, expressions of disbelief fromscientists, offers from holie producers and book publishers forexclusive rights to Rachel's life, and a barrage of real estate offers.Reichs University paid for a team of evaluators to sort the offers andsee if anything might benefit Rachel.Most of the communications were discarded. A few medical or researchoffers were seriously considered. In the end, none seemed to offer anyavenue of research or experimental therapy which Reichs had not alreadytried. One fatline flimsy came to Sol's attention. It was from theChairman of Kibbutz K'far Shalom on Hebron and read simply:IF IT BECOMES' TOO MUCH, COME.It soon became too much. After the first few months of publicity thesiege seemed to lift, but this was only the prelude to the second act.Faxsimmed tabloids referred to Sol as the 'Wandering Jew,' the desperatefather wandering afar in search of a cure for his child's bizarreillness- an ironic title given Sol's lifelong dislike of travel. Saraiinevitably was 'the grieving mother." Rachel was 'the doomed child' or,in one inspired headline, 'Virgin Victim of the Time Tombs' Curse." Noneof the family could go outside without finding a newsteep or imagerhiding behind a tree.Crawford discovered that there was money to be found in the Weintraubs'misfortune. At first the town held the line, but when entrepreneursfrom Bussard City moved in with gift shops, T-shirt concessions, tours,and datachip booths for the tourists who were coming in larger andlarger numbers, the local business people first dithered, then wavered,then decided unanimously that, if t here was commerce to be carried on,the profits should not go to outsiders.After four hundred and thirty-eight standard years of comparativesolitude, the town of Crawford received a farcaster terminex. No longerdid visitors have to suffer the twenty-minute flight from Bussard City.The crowds grew.On the day they moved it rained heavily and the streets were empty.Rachel did not cry, but her eyes were very wide all day and she spoke insubdued tones. It was ten days beforeher sixth birthday." But, Daddy, why do we have to move?" 'We just do,honey." 'But why?"'It's something we have to do, little one. You'll like Hebron. Thereare lots of parks there."'But how come you never saidwe were going to move?" 'We did, sweetie.You must have forgotten."'But what about Gram and Grams and Uncle Richardand Aunt Tetha and Uncle Saul and everybody?"'They can come visit us any time."'But what about Niki and Linna and my friends?"Sol said nothing but carried the last of the luggage to the EMV. Thehouse was sold and empty; furniture had been sold or sent ahead toHebron. For a week there had been a steady stream of family and oldfriends, college associates, and even some of the Reichs reed team whohad worked with Rachel for eighteen years, but now the street was empty.Rain streaked the Perspex canopy of the old EMV and ran in complexrivulets. The three of them sat in the vehicle for a moment, staring atthe house. The interior smelled of wet wool and wet hair.Rachel clutched the teddy bear Sarai had resurrected from the attic sixmonths earlier. She said,' It's not fair."'No,' agreed Sol." It's not fair."Hebron was a desert world. Four centuries of terra-forming had made theatmosphere breathable and a few million acres of land arable. Thecreatures which had livedthere before were small and tough and infinitely wary, and so were thecreatures imported from Old Earth, including the human kind.'Ahh,' gasped Sol the day they arrived in the sun-baked village of Danabove the sun-baked ibbutz of K'far Shalom, 'what masochists we Jewsare. Twenty thousand surveyed worlds fit for our kind when the Hegirabegan, and those schmucks came here."But it was not masochism which brought either the first colonists or Soland his family. Hebron was mostly desert, but the fertile areas werealmost frighteningly fertile. Sinai University was respected throughoutthe Web and its Med Center brought in wealthy patients and a healthyincome for the cooperative. Hebron had a single farcaster terminex inNew Jerusalem and allowed portals nowhere else. Belonging to neitherthe Hegemony nor Protectorate, Hebron taxed travelers heavily forfarcaster privilege and allowed no tourists outside New Jerusalem. Fora Jew seeking privacy, it was perhaps the safest place in three hundredworlds trod by man.The kibbutz was more a cooperative by tradition than in operation. TheWeintraubs were welcomed to their own home - a modest place offeringsun-dried adobe, curves instead of right angles, and bare wood floo o,b.".also offering a view from the hill which showed an infinite expanse ofdesert beyond the orange and olive groves. The sun seemed to dry upeverything, thought Sol, even .worries and bad dreams. The light was aphysical thing. In the evening their house glowed pink for an hourafter the sun had set.Each morning Sol sat by his daughter's bed until she awoke. The firstminutes of her confusion were always painful to him, but he made surethat he was the first thing Rachel saw each day. He held her while sheasked her questions.'Where are we, Daddy?"'In a wonderful place, little one. I'll tell you all about it overbreakfast."'How did we get here?"'By 'casting and flying and walking a bit,' he would say. 'It's not sofar away... but far enough to make it an adventure."'But my bed's here... my stuffed animals... why don't I remembercoming?"And Sol would hold her gently by the shoulders and look into her browneyes and say, 'You had an accident, Rachel. Remember in The HomesickToad where Terrence hits his head and forgets where he lives for afew days? It was sort of like that."'Am I better?"'Yes,' Sol would say, 'you're all better now." And the house would fillwith the smell of breakfast and they would go out to the terrace whereSarai waited.Rachel had more playmates than ever. The kibbutz cooperative had aschool where she was always the welcomed visitor, greeted anew each day.In the long afternoons the children played in the orchards and exploredalong the cliffs.Avner, Robert, and Ephraim, the Council elders, urged Sol to work on hisbook. Hebron prided itself on the number of scholars, artists,musicians, philosophers, writers and composers it sheltered as citizensand long-term residents. The house, they pointed out, was a gift of thestate. Sol's pension, though small by We,b standards, was more thanadequate for their modest needs in K'far Shalom. To Sol's surprise,however, he found that he enjoyed physical labor. Whether working inthe orchards or clearing stones in the unclaimed fields or repairing awall above the city, Sol found that his mind and spirit were freer thanthey had been in many years. He discovered that he could wrestle withKierkegaard while he waited for mortar to dry and find new insights inKant and Vandeur while carefully checking the apples for worms. At theage of seventy-three standard, Sol earned his first calluses.In the evenings he would play with Rachel and then take a walk in thefoothills with Sarai as Judy or one of the other neighbor girls watchedtheir sleeping child.One weekend they went away to New Jerusalem, just Soland Sarai, the first time they had been alone together for that longsince Rachel returned to live with them seventeen standard years before.But everything was not idyllic. Too frequent were the nights when Solawoke alone and walked barefoot down the hall to see Sarai watching overRachel in her sleep.And often at the end of a long day, bathing Rachel in the old ceramictub or tucking her in as the walls glowed pinkly, the child would say,'I like it here, Daddy, but can we go home tomorrow?" And Sol would nod.And after the good-night story, and the lullaby, and the good-nightkiss, sure that she was asleep, he would begin to tiptoe out of the roomonly to hear the muffled  'Later, alligator' from the blanketed form onthe bed, to which he had to reply ' 'While, crocodile." And lying in bedhimself, next to the softly breathing and possibly sleeping length ofthe woman he loved, Sol would watch the strips of pale light from one orboth of Hebron's small moons move across the rough walls and he wouldtalk to God.Sol had been talking to God for some months before he realized what hewas doing. The idea amused him. The dialogues were in no way prayersbut took the form of angry monologues which - just short of the pointwhere they became aliatribes- became vigorous arguments with himself.Only not just with himself. Sol realized one day that the topics of theheated debates were so profound, the stakes to be settled so serious,the ground covered so broad, that the only person he could possibly beberating for such shortcomings was God Himself.Since the concept of a personal God, lying awake at night worrying abouthuman beings, intervening in the lives of individuals, always had beentotally absurd to Sol, thethought of such dialogues made him doubt his sanity.But the dialogues continue,'Sol wanted to know how an 'ical system - much less a religion soindomitable that it t,td survived every evil mankind could throw at it-could flow from a command from God for a man to slaughter his on. Itdid not matter to Sol that the command had been rescinded at the lastmoment. It did not matter that the command was a test of obedience. Infact, the idea that it was the obedience of Abraham which allowed him tobecome the father of all the tribes of Israel was precisely what droveSol into fits of fury.After fifty-five years of dedicating his life and work to the story ofethical systems, Sol Weintraub had come to a single, unshakableconclusion: any allegiance to a deity or concept or universal principlewhich put obedience above decent behavior toward an innocent human beingwas evil.- So define 'innocent'?. came the vaguely amused, faintlyquerulous voice which Sol associated with these arguments.--A child is innocent, thought Sol. Isaac was.Rachel is.- 'Innocent' by the mere fact of being a child?- Yes.- And there is no situation where the blood of the innocent mustbe shed for a greater cause?- No, thought Sol. None.- But the 'innocent' are not restricted to children, I presume.- Sol hesitated, sensing a trap, trying to see where hissubconscious interlocutor was heading. He could not. No, he thought,the 'innocent' include others as well as children.- Such as Rachel? At age twenty-four? The innocent shouM notbe sacrificed at any age?- That's right.--Perhaps this is part of the lesson which Abraham needed to learnbefore he could befather to the blessed of the nations of the earth.--What lesson? thought Sol. What lesson? Butthe voice in his mind had faded and now there were only the sounds ofnight birds outside and the soft breathing of his wife beside him.Rachel could still read at age five. Sol had trouble remembering whenshe had learned to read - it seemedshe always had been able to. 'Four standard,' said Sarai.'It was early summer... three months after her birthday.We were picnicking in the field above the college, Rachel was looking ather Winnie-the-Pooh book, andsuddenly she said, "I hear a voice in my head"."Sol remembered then.He also remembered the joy he and Sarai had felt at the rapidacquisition of new skills Rachel had shown at that age. He rememberedbecause now they were confronted with the reverse of that process.'Dad,' said Rachel from where she lay on the floor of his study,carefully coloring, 'how long has it been since Mom's birthday?"'It was on Monday,' said Sol, preoccupied with something he was reading.Sarai's birthday had not yet come but Rachel remembered it.'I know. But how long has it been since then?"'Today is Thursday,' said Sol. He was reading a long Talmudic treatiseon obedience.'I know. But how many days?"Sol put down. the hard copy. 'Can you name the days of the week?"Barnard's World had used the old calendar.'Sure,' said Rachel. 'Saturday, Sunday, Monday,Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday..." 'You said Saturdayalready." 'Yeah. But how many days ago?"'Can you count from Monday to Thursday?"Rachel frowned, moved her lips. She tried again, counting on herfingers this time. 'Four days?"'Good,' said Sol. 'Can you tell me what ten minus four is, kiddo?"'What does minus mean?"Sol forced himself to look at his papers again.'Nothing,' he said. 'Something you'll learn at school."'When we go home tomorrow?"'Yes."One morning when Rachel went off with Judy to play with the otherchildren - she was too young to attend school any longer - Sarai said:'Sol, we have to take her to Hyperion."Sol stared at her. 'What?"'You heard me. We can't wait until she is too young to walk... totalk. Also, we're not getting any younger." Sarai barked a mirthlesslaugh. 'That sounds strange, doesn't it? But we're not. The Poulsentreatments will be wearing off in a year or two."'Sarai, did you forget? The doctors all say that Rachel could notsurvive cryogenic fugue. No one experiences FTL travel without fuguestate. The Hawking effect can drive one mad... or worse."'It doesn't matter,' said Sarai. 'Rachel has to return to Hyperion."'What on earth are you talking about?" said Sol, angered.Sarai gripped his hand. 'Do you think you're the onlyone who has had the dream?"'Dream?" managed Sol.She sighed and sat at the white kitchen table. Morning light struck theplants on the sill like a yellow spotlight.'The dark place,' she said. 'The red lights above. The voice. Tellingus to... telling us to take... to go to Hyperion. To make... anoffering."Sol licked his lips but there was no moisture there.His heart pounded. 'Whose name... whose name is called?"Sarai looked at him strangely. 'Both of our names. If you weren'tthere... in the dream with me... I could never have borne it all theseyears."Sol collapsed into his chair. He looked down at the strange hand andforearm lying on the table. The knuckles of the hand were beginning toenlarge with arthritis; the forearm was heavily veined, marked withliver spots.It was his hand, of course. He heard himself say: 'You never mentionedit. Never said a word..."This time Sarai's laugh was without bitterness. 'As if I had to! Allthose times both of us coming awake in the dark. And you covered withsweat. I knew from the first time that it was not merely a dream. Wehave to go, Father. Go to Hyperion."Sol moved the hand. It still did not feel a part of him.'Why? For God's sake, why, Sarai? We can't... offer Rachel..."'Of course not, Father. Haven't you thought about this? We have to goto Hyperion . . . to wherever the dream tells us to go... and offerourselves instead."'Offer ourselves,' repeated Sol. He wondered if he was having a heartattack. His chest ached so terribly that he could not take in a breath.He sat for a full minute in silence, convinced that if he attempted toutter a word only a sob would escape. After another minute he said:'How long have you . . . thought about this, Mother?"'Do you mean known what we must do? A year. A little more. Just afterher fifth birthday."'A year! Why haven't you said something?"'I was waiting for you. To realize. To know."Sol shook his head. The room seemed far away and slightly tilted. 'No.I mean, it doesn't seem... I have to think, Mother." Sol watched as thestrange hand patted Sarai's familiar hand.She nodded.Sol spent three days and nights in the arid mountains, eating only thethick-crusted bread he had brought and drinking from his condensertherm.Ten thousand times in the past twenty years he had wished that he couldtake Rachel's illness; that if anyone had to suffer it should be thefather, not the child. Any parent would feel that way - did feel thatway every time his child lay injured or racked with fever. Surely itcould not be that simple.In the heat of the third afternoon, as he lay half dozing in the shadeof a thin tablet of rock, Sol learned that it was not that simple.Can that be Abraham's answer to God? That he would be the offering, notIsaac?It could have been Abraham's. It cannot be yours.Why?As if in answer, Sol had the fever-vision of naked adults filing towardthe ovens past armed men, mothers hiding their children under piles ofcoats. He saw' men and women with flesh hanging in burned stripscarrying the dazed children from the ashes of what once had been a city.Sol knew that these images were no dreams, were the very stuff of theFirst and Second Holocausts, and in his understanding knew before thevoice spoke in his mind what the answer was. What it must be.The parents have offered themselves. That sacrifice already has beenaccepted. We are beyond that.Then what? What!Silence answered him. Sol stood in the full glare of the sun, almostfell. A black bird wheeled overhead or in his vision. Sol shook hisfist at the gunmetal sky.You use Nazis as your instruments. Madmen.Monsters. You're a goddamn monster yourself.mtqo.The earth tilted and Sol fell on his side against sharp rocks. Hethought that it was not unlike leaning against a rough wall. A rock thesize of his fist burned his cheek.The correct answer for Abraham was obedience, thought Sol. Ethically,Abraham was a child himself. All men were at that time. The correctanswer for Abraham's children was to become adults and to offerthemselves instead.What is the correct answer for us?There was no answer. The ground and sky quit spinning.After a while Sol rose shakily, rubbed the blood and grit from hischeek, and walked down to the town in the valley below.'No,' Sol told Sarai, 'we will not go to Hyperion. It is not thecorrect solution."'You would have us do nothing then." Sarai's lips were white with angerbut her voice was firmly in control.'No. I would have us not to do the wrong thing." Sarai expelled herbreath in a hiss. She waved toward the window where their four-year-oldwas visible playing with her toy horses in the backyard. 'Do you thinkshe has time for us to do the wrong thing... or anything  . .indefinitely?"'Sit down, Mother."Sarai remained standing. There was the faintest sprinkling of spilledsugar on the front of her tan cotton dress. Sol remembered the youngwoman rising nude from the phosphorescent wake of the motile isle onMaul-Covenant.'We have to do something,' she said.'We've seen over a hundred medical and scientific experts. She's beentested, prodded, probed, and tortured by two dozen research centers.l've been to the Shrike Church on every world in this Web; they won'tsee me. Melio and the other Hyperion experts at Reichs say that theShrike Cult has nothing like the Merlin sickness in their doctrine andthe indigenies on Hyperion have no legends of the malady or clues to itscure.Research during the three years the team was on Hyperion showed nothing.Now research there is illegal.Access to the Time Tombs is granted only to the so-called pilgrims. Evengetting a travel visa to Hyperion is becoming almost impossible. And ifwe take Rachel; the trip may kill her."Sol paused for breath, touched Sarai's arm again.'I'm sorry to repeat all this, Mother. But we have done something."'Not enough,' said Sarai. 'What if we go as pilgrims?" Sol folded hisarms in frustration. 'The Church of the Shrike chooses its sacrificialvictims from thousands of volunteers. The Web is full of stupid,depressed people.Few of these return."'Doesn't that prove something?" Sarai whispered quickly, urgently.'Somebody or something is preying on these people."'Bandits,' said Sol.Sarai shook her head 'The golem."'You mean the Shrike."'It's the golem,' insisted Sarai. 'The same one we see in the dream."Sol was uneasy. 'l don't see a golem in the dream.What golem?"'The red eyes that watch,' said Sarai. 'It's the samegolem that Rachel heard that night in the Sphinx." 'How do you know thatshe heard anything?"'It's in the dream,' said Sarai. 'Before we enter the place where thegolem waits."'We haven't dreamed the same dream,' said Sol.'Mother, Mother ... why haven't you told me this before?"'I thought I was going mad,' whispered Sarai.Sol thought of his secret conversations with God and put his arm aroundhis wife.'Oh, Sol,' she whispered against him, 'it hurts so much to watch. Andit's so lonely here."Sol held her. They had tried to go home- home would always be Barnard'sWorld - half a dozen times to visit family and friends, but each timethe visits were ruined by an invasion of newsteeps and tourists. It wasno one's fault. News traveled almost instantaneously through themegadatasphere of a hundred and sixty Web worlds. To scratch thecuriosity itch one had only to pass a universal card across a terminexdiskey and step through a farcaster. They had tried arrivingunannounced and traveling incognito but they were not spies and theefforts were pitiful. Within twenty-four standard hours of theirreentry to the Web, they were besieged. Research institutes and largemed centers easily provided the security screen for such a visit, butfriends and family suffered. Rachel was NEWS.'Perhaps we could invite Tetha and Richard again  . ." began Sarai.'I have a better idea,' said Sol. 'Go yourself, Mother.You want to see your sister but you also want to see, hear, and smellhome... watch a sunset where there are no iguanas... walk in thefields. Go."'Go? Just me? I couldn't be away from Rachel..." 'Nonsense,' said Sol.'Twice in twenty years - almost forty if we count the good days before .. . anyway, twice in twenty years doesn't constitute child neglect.It's a wonder that this family can stand one another, we've been coopedup together so long."Sarai looked at the tabletop, lost in thought. 'But wouldn't the newspeople find me?"'I bet not,' said Sol. 'It's Rachel they seem to key on.If they do hound you, come home. But I bet you can have a week visitingeveryone at home before the teeps catch on."'A week,' gasped Sarai. 'I couldn't..."'Of course you can. In fact, you must. It will give me a few days tospend more time with Rachel and then when you come back refreshed I'llspend some days selfishly working on the book."'The Kierkegaard one?"'No. Something l've been playing with called The Abraham Problem."'Clumsy title,' said Sarai.'It's a clumsy problem,' said Sol. 'Now go get packed.We'll fly you to New Jerusalem tomorrow so you can 'cast out before theSabbath begins."'I'11 think about it,' she said, sounding unconvinced.'You'll pack,' said Sol, hugging her again. When the hug was completedhe had turned her away from the window so that she faced the hallway andthe bedroom door. 'Go. When you return from home VII have thought ofsomething we can do."Sarai paused. 'Do you promise?"Sol looked at her. 'I promise I will before time destroys everything. Iswear as Rachel's father that VIi find a way."Sarai nodded, more relaxed than he had seen her in months. 'l'll gopack,' she said.When he and the child returned from New Jerusalem the next day, Sol wentout to water the meager lawn while Rachel played quietly inside. Whenhe came in, the pink glow of sunset infusing the walls with a sense ofsea warmth and quiet, Rachel was not in her bedroom or the other usualplaces. 'Rachel?"When there was no answer he checked the backyard again, the emptystreet.'Rachel!" Sol ran in to call the neighbors but suddenly there was theslightest of sounds from the deep closet Sarai used for storage. Solquietly opened the screen panel.Rachel sat beneath the hanging clothes, Sarai's antique pine box openbetween her legs. The floor was littered with photos and holochips ofRachel as a high school student, Rachel on the day she set off forcollege, Rachel standing in front of a carved mountainside on Hyperion.Rachel's research comlog lay whispering on the four-year-old Rachel'slap. Sol's heart seized at the familiar sound of the confident youngwoman's voice.'Daddy,' said the child on the floor, her own voice a tiny frightenedecho of the voice on the comlog, 'younever told me that I had a sister."'You don't, little one."Rachel frowned. 'Is this Mommy when she was . . .not so big? Uh-uh, it can't be. Her name's Rachel, too, she says. Howcan..."'It's all right,' he said. 'VII explain . . ." Sol realized that thephone was ringing in the living room, had been ringing. 'Just a moment,sweetie. I'll be right back."The holo that formed above the pit was of a man Sol had never seenbefore. Sol did not activate his own imager, eager to get rid of thecaller. 'Yes?" he said abruptly.'M. Weintraub? M. Weintraub who used to live on Barnard's World,currently in the village of Dan on Hebron?"Sol started to disconnect and then paused. Their access code wasuntiled. Occasionally a salesperson called from New Jerusalem, butoffworld calls were rare. And, Sol suddenly realized, his stomachfeeling a stab of cold, it was past sundown on the Sabbath. Onlyemergency holo calls were allowed.'Yes?" said Sol.'M. Weintraub,' said the man, staring blindly past Sol, 'there's been aterrible accident."When Rachel awoke her father was sitting by the side of her bed. Helooked tired. His eyes were red and his cheeks were gray with stubbleabove the line of his beard.'Good morning, Daddy."'Good morning, sweetheart."Rachel looked around and blinked. Some of her dolls and toys and thingswere there, but the room was not hers. The light was different. Theair felt different. Herdaddy looked different. 'Where are we, Daddy?" 'We've gone on a trip,little one." 'Where to?"'It doesn't matter right now. Hop out, sweetie. Your bath is ready andthen we have to get dressed."A dark dress she had never seen before lay at the base of her bed.Rachel looked at the dress and then back at her father. 'Daddy, what'sthe matter? Where's Mommy?" Sol rubbed his cheek. It was the third morning since the accident. Itwas the day of the funeral. He had told her each of the preceding daysbecause he could not imagine lying to her then; it seemed the ultimatebetrayal- of both Sarai and Rachel. But hc did not think he could do itagain. 'There's been an accident, Rachel,' he said, his voice a painedrasp. 'Mommy died.We're going to go say goodbye to her today." Sol paused. He knew by nowthat it would take a minute for the fact of her mother's death to becomereal for Rachel.On the first day he had not known if a four-year-old could trulycomprehend the concept of death. He knew now that Rachel could.Later, as he held the sobbing child, Sol tried to understand theaccident he had described so briefly to her.EMVs were by far the safest form of personal transportation mankind hadever designed. Their lifters could fail but, even so, the residualcharge in the EM generators would allow the aircar to descend safelyfrom any altitude. The basic, failsafe design of an EMV'scollision-avoidance equipment had not changed in centuries. Buteverything failed. In this case it was a joy-riding teenage couple in astolen EMV outside the traffic lanes, accelerating to Mach 1.5 with alllights and transponders off to avoid detection, who defied all odds bycolliding with Aunt Tetha's ancient Vikken as it descended toward theBussard City Opera House landing apron. Besides Tetha and Sarai and theteenagers, three others died in the crash as pieces of falling vehiclescartwheeled into the crowded atrium of the Opera Houseitself.Sarai.'Will we ever see Mommy again?" Rachel asked between sobs. She hadasked this each time.'I don't know, sweetheart,' responded Sol truthfully.The funeral was at the family cemetery in gates County on Barnard'sWorld. The press did not invade the graveyard itself but teeps hoveredbeyond the trees and pressed against the black iron gate like an angrystorm tide.Richard wanted Sol and Rachel to stay a few days, but Sol knew what painwould be inflicted on the quiet farmer if the press continued theirassault. Instead, he hugged Richard, spoke briefly to the clamoringreporters beyond the fence, and fled to Hebron with a stunned and silentRachel in tow.Newsteeps followed to New Jerusalem and then attempted to follow to Dan,but military police overrode their chartered EMVs, threw a dozen in jailas an example, and revoked the farcaster visas of the rest.In the evening Sol walked the ridge lines above the village while Judywatched his sleeping child. He found that his dialogue with God wasaudible now and he resisted the urge to shake his fist at the sky, toshout obscenities, to throw stones. Instead he asked questions, alwaysending with - Why?There was no answer. Hebron's sun set behind distant ridges and therocks glowed as they gave up their heat. Sol sat on a boulder andrubbed his temples with his palms.Sarai.They had lived a full life, even with the tragedy of Rachel's illnesshanging over them. It was too ironic that in Sarai's first hour ofrelaxation with her sister... Sol moaned aloud.The trap, of course, had been in their total absorption with Rache!'sillness. Neither had been able to face the future beyond Racbe!'s...death? Disappearance? The world had hinged upon each day their childlived and no thought had been given to the chance of accident, theperverse antilogic of a sharp-edged universe. Sol was sure that Saraihad considered suicide just as he had, but neither of them could everhave abandoned the other. Or Rachel. He had never considered thepossibility of beingalone with Rachel when...Sarai!At that moment Sol realized that the often angry dialogue which hispeople had been having with God for so many millennia had not ended withthe death of Old Earth... nor with the new Diaspora... but continuedstill. He and Rachel and Sarai had been part of it, were part of itnow. He let the pain come. It filled him with the sharp-edged agony ofresolve.Sol stood on the ridge line and wept as darkness fell.In the morning he was next to Rachel's bed when sunlight filled theroom.'Good morning, Daddy." 'Good morning, sweetheart." 'Where are we,Daddy?"'We've gone on a trip. It's a pretty place."'Where's Mommy?"'She's with Aunt Tetha today."'Will we see her tomorrow?"'Yes,' said Sol. 'Now let's get you dressed and I'll make breakfast."Sol began to petition the Church of the Shrike when Rachel turned three.Travel to Hyperion was severely limited and access to the Time Tombs hadbecome all but impossible. Only the occasional Shrike Pilgrimage sentpeople to that region.Rachel was sad that she had to be away from hermother on her birthday but the visit of several children from thekibbutz distracted her a bit. Her big present was an illustrated bookof fairy tales which Sarai had picked out in New Jerusalem monthsbefore.S01 read some of the stories to Rachel before bedtime.It had been seven months since she could read any of the words herself.But she loved the stories- especially 'Sleeping Beauty' - and made herfather read it to her twice.'I'm gonna show Mommy it when we get home,' she said through a yawn asSol turned out the overhead light.'Good night, kiddo,' he said softly, pausing at the door.'Hey, Daddy?"'Yes?"' 'Later, alligator."' 'While, crocodile."Rachel giggled into her pillow.It was, Sol thought during the final two years, not so much differentfrom watching a loved one falling into old age. Only worse. A thousandtimes worse.Rachel's permanent teeth had fallen out over intervals between hereighth and second birthdays. Baby teeth replaced them but by hereighteenth month half of these had receded into her jaw.Rachei's hair, always her one vanity, grew shorter and thinner. Herface lost its familiar structure as baby fat obscured the cheekbones andfirm chin. Her coordination failed by degrees, noticeable at first in asudden clumsiness as she handled a fork or pencil. On the day she couldno longer walk, Sol put her down in her crib early and then went intohis study to get thoroughly and quietly drunk.Language was the hardest for him. Her vocabulary loss was like theburning of a bridge between them, the severing of a final line of hope.It was sometime after her second birthday receded that Sol tucked her inand, pausing in the doorway, said, ''Later, alligator."'Huh?"'See you later, alligator.Rachel si,led.'You say- "In a while, crocodile," ' said Sol. Hetold her what an alligator and crocodile were.'In a while, 'acadile,' giggled Rachel.In the morning she had forgotten.Sol took Rachel with him as he traveled the Web - no longer caring aboutthe newsteeps- petitioning the Shrike Church for pilgrimage rights,lobbying the Senate for a visa and access to forbidden areas onHyperion, and visiting any research institute or clinic which mightoffer a cure. Months were lost while more medics admitted failure. Whenhe fled back to Hebron, Rachel was fifteen standard months old; in theancient units used on Hebron she weighed twenty-five pounds and measuredthirty inches tall. She could no longer dress herself. Her vocabularyconsisted of twenty-five words, of which her favorites were 'Mommy' and'Daddy."SOl loved carrying his daughter. There were times when the curve of herhead against his cheek, her warmth against his chest, the smell of herskin - all worked to allow him to forget the fierce injustice of it all.At those times Sol would have been temporarily at peace with theuniverse if only Sarai had been there. As it was, there were temporarycease-fires in his angry dialogue with a God in Whom he did not believe.What possible reason can there be for this?What reason has been visible for all of the forms of pain suffered byhumankind?Precisely, thought Sol, wondering if he had just won a point for thefirst time. He doubted it.The fact of a thing not being visible does not mean it does not exist.That's clumsy. It shouldn't take three negatives to make a statement.Especially to state something as nonprofound as that.- Precisely, Sol. You're beginning to get the drift of allthis.- What?There was no answer to his thoughts. Sol lay in his house and listenedto the desert wind blow.Rachel's last word was 'Mamma,' uttered when she was just over fivemonths old.She awoke in her crib and did not - could not - ask where she was. Herworld was one of mealtimes, naps, and toys. Sometimes when she criedSol wondered if she was crying for her mother.Sol shopped in the small stores in Dan, taking the infant with him as heselected diapers, nursing paks, and the occasional new toy.The week before Sol left for Tau Ceti Center, Ephraim and the two otherelders came to talk. It was evening and the fading light glowed onEphraim's bald scalp. 'Sol, we're worried about you. The next fewweeks will be hard. The women want to help. We want to help."Sol laid his hand on the older man's forearm. 'It's appreciated,Ephraim. Everything the last few years is appreciated. This is ourhome now, too. $arai would have... would have wanted me to say thankyou. But we're leaving on Sunday. Rachel is going to get better."The three men on the long bench looked at one another.Avner said, 'They've found a cure?"'No,' said Sol, 'but I've found a reason to hope." 'Hope is good,'Robert said in cautious tones.Sol grinned, his teeth white against the gray of his beard. 'It hadbetter be,' he said. 'Sometimes it is all we're given."The studio holo camera zoomed in for a close-up of Rachel as the infantsat cradled in Sol's arm on the set of 'Common Talk." 'So you'resaying,' said Devon Whiteshire, the show's host and the third-best-knownface in the Web datasphere, 'that the Shrike Church's refusal to allowyou to return to the Time Tombs...and the Hegemony's tardiness in processing a visa...these things will doom your child to this... extinction?"'Precisely,' said Sol. 'The voyage to Hyperion cannot be made in undersix weeks. Rachel is now twelve weeks old.Any further delay by either the Shrike Church or the Web bureaucracywill kill this child."The studio audience stirred. Devon Whiteshire turned toward the nearestimaging remote. His craggy, friendly visage filled the monitor frame.'This man doesn't know if he can save his child,' said Whiteshire, hisvoice powerful with subtle feeling, 'but all he asks is a chance. Doyou think he... and the baby... deserve one? If so, access yourplanetary representatives and your nearest Church of the Shrike temple.The number of your nearest temple should be appearing now." He turnedback to Sol. 'We wish you luck, M. Weintraub. And' - Whiteshire'slarge hand touched Rache!'s cheek - 'we wish you Godspeed, our youngfriend."The monitor image held on Rachel until it faded to black.The Hawking effect caused nausea, vertigo, headache, and hallucinations.The first leg of the voyage was the ten-day transit to Parvati on theHegemony torchship HS Intrepid.Sol held Rachel and endured. They were the only people fully consciousaboard the warship. At first Rachel cried, but after some hours she layquietly in SOI's arms and stared up at him with large, dark eyes. Solremembered the day she was born - the medics had taken tbe infant fromatop Sarai's warm stomach and handed her to Sol.Rachel's dark hair was not much shorter then, her gaze no less profound.Eventually they slept from sheer exhaustion.Sol dreamed that he was wandering through a structure with columns thesize of redwood trees and a ceiling lost to sight far above him. Redlight bathed cool emptiness. Sol was surprised to find that he stillcarried Rachel in his arms.Rachel as a child had never been in his dream before. The infant lookedup at him and Sol felt the contact of her consciousness as surely as ifshe had spoken aloud.Suddenly a different voice, immense and cold, echoed through the void:'Sol! Take your daughter, your only daughter Rachel, Whom you love, andgo to the world called Hyperion and offer her there as a burnt offeringat one of the places of which I shall tell you."Sol hesitated and looked back to Rachel. The baby's eyes were deep andluminous as she looked up at her father. Sol felt the unspoken yes.Holding her tightly, he stepped forward into the darkness and raised hisvoice against the silence:'Listen! There will be no more offerings, neither child nor parent.There will be no more sacrifices for anyone other than our fellow human.The time of obedience and atonement is past."Sol listened. He could feel the pounding of his heart and Rachel'swarmth against his arm. From somewhere high above there came the coldsound of wind through unseen fissures. Sol cupped his hand to his mouthand shouted:'That's all! Now either leave us alone or join us as a father ratherthan a receiver of sacrifices. You have the choice of Abraham!'Rachel stirred in his arms as a rumble grew out of the stone floor.Columns vibrated. The red gloom deepened and then winked out, leavingonly darkness.From far away there came the boom of huge footsteps.Sol hugged Rachel to him as a violent wind roared past.There was a glimmer of light as both he and Rachel awoke on the HSIntrepid outward bound for Parvati to transfer to the treeshipYggdrasill for the planet Hyperion. Sol smiled at his seven-week-olddaughter.She smiled back.It was her last and her first smile.The main cabin of the windwagon was silent when the old scholar finishedhis story. Sol cleared his throat and took a drink of water from acrystal goblet. Rachel slept on in the makeshift cradle of the opendrawer. The windwagon rocked gently on its way, the rumble of the greatwheel and the hum of the main gyroscope a lu!ling background noise.'My God,' Brawne Lamia said softly. She started to speak again and thenmerely shook her head.Martin Silenus closed his eyes and said:'Considering that, all hatred driven hence, The soul recovers radicalinnocenceAnd learns at last that it is self-delighting, Self-appeasing,seif-affrighting,And that its own sweet will is Heaven's will; She can, though every facewill scowlAnd every windy quarter howlOr every bellows burst, be happy still."Sol Weintraub asked, 'William Butler Yeats?" Silenus nodded. ' "APrayer for My Daughter." ''I think l'm going up on deck for a breath of air before turning in,'said the Consul. 'Would anyone care to join me?"Everyone did. The breeze of their passage was refreshing as the groupstood on the quarterdeck and watched the darkened Sea of Grass rumbleby. The sky was a great, star-splashed bowl above them, scarred bymeteor trails. The sails and rigging creaked with a sound as old ashuman travel.'I think we should post guards tonight,' said Colonel Kassad. 'Oneperson on watch while the others sleep.Two-hours intervals."'I agree,' said the Consul. 'l'il take the first watch." 'In themorning..." began Kassad.'Look!" cried Father Hoyt.They followed his pointing arm. Between the blaze of constellations,colored fireballs flared- green, violet,orange, green again- illuminating the great plain of grass around themlike flashes of heat lightning. The stars and meteor trails paled toinsignificance beside the sudden display.'Explosions?" ventured the priest.'Space battle,' said Kassad. 'Cislunar. Fusion weapons." He went belowquickly.'The Tree,' said l-let Masteen, pointing to a speck of light which movedamong the explosions like an ember floating through a fireworks display.Kassad returned with his powered binoculars and handed them around.'Ousters?" asked Lamia. 'Is it the invasion?" 'Ousters, almostcertainly,' said Kassad. 'But almost as certainly just a scouting raid.See the clusters? Those are Hegemony missiles being exploded by theOuster ramscouts' countermeasures."The binoculars came to the Consul. The flashes were quite clear now, anexpanding cumulus of flame. He could see the speck and long blue tailof at least two scoutships fleeing from the Hegemony pursuers.'I don't think..." began Kassad and then stopped as the ship and sailsand Sea of Grass glowed bright orange in reflected glare.'Dear Christ,' whispered Father Hoyt. 'They've hit the treeship."The Consult swept the glass left. The growing nimbus of flames could beseen with the naked eye but in the binoculars the kilometer-long trunkand branch array of the Yggdrasiil was visible for an instant as itburned and flared, long tendrils of flame arcing away into space as thecontainment fields failed and the oxygen burned.The orange cloud pulsed, faded, and fell back on itself as the trunkbecame visible for a final second even as it glowed and broke up likethe last long ember in a dying fire. Nothing could have survived. Thetreeship Yggdrasill with its crew and complement of clones andsemisentient erg drivers was dead.The Consul turned toward Het Masteen and belatedly held out thebinoculars. 'I'm so ... sorry,' he whispered.The tall Templar did not take the glasses. Slowly he lowered his gazefrom the skies, pulled forward his cowl, and went below without a word.The death of the treeship was the final explosion.When ten minutes had passed and no more flares had disturbed the night,Brawne Lamia spoke. 'Do you think they got them?"'The Ousters?" said Kassad. 'Probably not. The scoutships are builtfor speed and defense. They're light-minutes away by now."'Did they go after the treeship on purpose?" asked Silenus. The poetsounded very sober.'I think not,' said Kassad. 'Merely a target of opportunity."'Target of opportunity,' echoed Sol Weintraub. The scholar shook hishead. 'I'm going to get a few hours' sleep before sunrise."One by one the others went below. When only Kassad and the Consul wereleft on deck, the Consul said, 'Where should I stand watch?"'Make a circuit,' said the Colonel. 'From the main corridor at the baseof the ladder you can see all of the stateroom doors and the entrance tothe mess and galley.Come above and check the gangway and decks. Keep thelanterns lit. Do you have a weapon?"The Consul shook his head.Kassad handed over his deathwand. 'It's on tight beam - about half ameter at ten meters' range. Don't use it unless you're sure thatthere's an intruder.The rough plate that slides forward is the safety.It's on."The Consul nodded, making sure that his finger stayed away from thefiring stud.'VII relieve you in two hours,' said Kassad. He checked his comlog.'It'll be sunrise before my watch is over." Kassad looked at the sky asif expecting the Yggdrasill to reappear and continue its firefly pathacross the sky. Only the stars glowed back. On the northeasternhorizon a moving mass of black promised a storm.Kassad shook his head. 'A waste,' he said and went below.The Consul stood there awhile and listened to the wind in the canvas,the creek of rigging, and the rumble of the wheel. After a while hewent to the railing and stared at darkness while he thought.FIVESunrise over the Sea of Grass was a thing of beauty. The Consul watchedfrom the highest point on the aft deck.After his watch he had tried to sleep, given it up, and come up ontodeck to watch the night fade into day. The stormfront had covered thesky with low clouds and the rising sun lit the world with brilliant goldreflected from above and below. The windwagon's sails and lines andweathered planks glowed in the brief benediction of light in the fewminutes before the sun was blocked by the ceiling of clouds and colorflowed out of the world once again. The wind which followed thiscurtain closing was chill, as if it had blown down from the snowy peaksof the Bridle Range just visible as a dark blur on the northeasternhorizon.Brawne Lamia and Martin Silenus joined the Consul on the aft deck, eachnursing a cup of coffee from the galley. The wind whipped and tugged atthe rigging.Brawne Lamia's thick mass of curls fluttered around her face like a darknimbus.'Morning,' muttered Silenus, squinting out over his coffee cup at thewind-rippled Sea of Grass.'Good morning,' replied the Consul, amazed at how alert and refreshed hefelt for not having slept at all the night before. 'We have a headwind,but the wagon still seems to be making decent time. We'll definitely beto the mountains before nightfall."'Hrrgnn,' commented Silenus and buried his nose in the coffee cup.'1 didn't sleep at all last night,' said Brawne Lamia, 'just forthinking about M. Weintraub's story. ''I don't think..." began the poet and then broke offas Weintraub came onto deck, his baby peering over the lip of an infantcarrier sling on his chest.'Good morning, everyone,' said Weintraub, looking around and taking adeep breath. 'Mmm, brisk, isn't it?"'Fucking freezing,' said Silenus. 'North of the mountains it'll be evenworse."'I think l'll go down to get a jacket,' said Lamia, but before she couldmove there came a single shrill cry from the deck below.'Blood!'There was, indeed, blood everywhere. Het Masteen's cabin was strangelyneat - bed unslept in, travel trunk and other boxes stacked precisely inone corner, robe folded over a chair - except for the blood whichcovered great sections of the deck, bulkhead, and overhead. The sixpilgrims crowded just inside the entrance, reluctant to go farther in.'I was passing on my way to the upper deck,' said Father Hoyt, his voicea strange monotone. 'The door was slightly ajar. I caught a glimpseof... the blood on the wall."'Is it blood?" demanded Martin Silenus.Brawn. Lamia stepped into the room, ran a hand through a thick smear onthe bulkhead, and raised her fingers to her lips. 'It's blood." Shelooked around, walked to the wardrobe, looked briefly among the emptyshelves and hangers, and then went to the small porthole.It was latched and bolted from the inside.Lenar Hoyt looked more ill than usual and staggered to a chair. 'Is hedead then?"'We don't know a damn thing except that Captain Masteen isn't in hisroom and a lot of blood/s,' said Lamia. She wiped her hand on her pantleg. 'The thing to do now is search the ship thoroughly."'Precisely,' said Colonel Kassad, 'and if we do not find the Captain?"Brawne Lamia opened the porthole. Fresh air dissipated theslaughterhouse smell of blood and brought in the rumble of the wheel andthe rustle of grass under the hull. 'If we don't find Captain Masteen,'shesaid, 'then we assume that he either left the ship under his own will orwas taken off."'But the blood..." began Father Hoyt.'Doesn't prove anything,' finished Kassad.'M. Lamia's correct. We don't know Masteen's blood type or genotype.Did anyone see or hear anything?"There was silence except for negative grunts and the shaking of heads.Martin Silenus looked around. 'Don't you people recognize the work ofour friend the Shrike when you see it?"'We don't know that,' snapped Lamia. 'Maybe someone wanted us to thinkthat it was the Shrike's doing."'That doesn't make sense,' said Hoyt, still gasping for air.'Nonetheless,' said Lamia, 'we'll search in twos. Who has weaponsbesides myself?."'I do,' said Colonel Kassad. 'I have extras if needed." 'No,' saidHoyt.The poet shook his head.Sol Weintraub had returned to the corridor with his child. Now helooked in again. 'I have nothing,' he said.'No,' said the Consul. He had returned the deathwand to Kassad when hisshift ended two hours before first light.'All right,' said Lamia, 'the priest will come with me on the lowerdeck. Silenus, go with the Colonel. Search the mid-deck. M.Weintraub, you and the Consul check everything above. Look for anythingout of the ordinary.Any sign of struggle."'One question,' said Silenus.'What?"'Who the hell elected you queen of the prom?"'I'm a private investigator,' said Lamia, leveling her gaze on the poet.Martin Silenus shrugged. 'Hoyt here is a priest of some forgottenreligion. That doesn't mean we have to genuflect when he says Mass."'All right,' sighed Brawne Lamia. 'I'll give you a better reason." Thewoman moved so fast that the Consulalmost missed the action in a blink. One second she was standing by theopen port and in the next she was half* way across the stateroom,lifting Martin Silenus off the deck with one arm, her massive handaround the poet's thin neck. 'How about,' she said, 'that you do thelogicalthing because it's the logical thing to do?"'Gkkrgghh,' managed Martin Silenus.'Good,' said Lamia without emotion and dropped the poet to the deck.Silenus staggered a meter and almost sat on Father Hoyt.'Here,' said Kassad, returning with two small neural stunners. Hehanded one to Sol Weintraub. 'What do you have?" Kassad asked Lamia.The woman reached into a pocket of her loose tunic and produced anancient pistol.Kassad looked at the relic for a moment and then nodded. 'Stay withyour partner,' he said. 'Don't shoot at anything unless it's positivelyidentified and unquestionably threatening."'That describes the bitch I plan to shoot,' said Silenus, stillmassaging his throat.Brawne Lamia took a half step toward the poet.Fedmahn Kassad said, 'Shut up. Let's get this over with." Silenusfollowed the Colonel out of the stateroom.Sol Weintraub approached the Consul, handed him the stunner. 'I don'twant to hold this thing with Rachel.Shall we go up?"The Consul took the weapon and nodded.The windwagon held no further sign of Templar Voice of the Tree HetMasteen. After an hour of searching, the group met in the stateroom ofthe missing man. The blood there seemed darker and drier.'Is there a chance that we missed something?" said Father Hoyt. 'Secretpassages? Hidden compartments?"'There's a chance,' said Kassad, 'but l swept the ship with heat andmotion sensors. If there's anything else on board larger than a mouse,I can't find it."'If you had these sensors,' said Silenus, 'why the fuck did you have uscrawling through bilge and byways for an hour?"'Because the right equipment or apparel can hide a man from aheat-'n'-beat search."'So, in answer to my question,' said Hoyt, pausing a second as a visiblewave of pain passed through him, 'with the right equipment or apparel,Captain Masteen might be hiding in a secret compartment somewhere."'Possible but improbable,' said Brawne Lamia. 'My guess is that he's nolonger aboard."'The Shrike,' said Martin Silenus in a disgusted tone.It was not a question.'Perhaps,' said Lamia. 'Colonel, you and the Consul were on watchthrough those four hours. Are you surethat you heard and saw nothing?"Both men nodded.'The ship was quiet,' said Kassad. 'I would have heard a struggle evenbefore I went on watch."'And I didn't sleep after my watch,' said the Consul.'My room shared a bulkhead with Masteen's. I heard nothing."'Well,' said Silenus, 'we've heard from the two men who were creepingaround in the dark with weapons when the poor shit was killed. They saythey're innocent.Next case! ''If Masteen was killed,' said Kassad, 'it was with no deathwand. Nosilent modern weapon I know throws that much blood around. There wereno gunshots heard -no bullet holes found- so I presume M. Lamia'sautomatic pistol is not suspect. If this is Captain Masteen's blood,then I would guess an edged weapon was used."'The Shrike/s an edged weapon,' said Martin Silenus.Lamia moved to the small stack of luggage. 'Debating isn't going tosolve anything. Let's see if there's anything in Masteen's belongings."Father Hoyt raised a hesitant hand. 'That's... well, private, isn'tit? I don't think we have the right."Brawne Lamia crossed her arms. 'Look, Father, if Masteen's dead, itdoesn't matter to him. If he's still alive, looking through this stuffmight give us some idea where he was taken. Either way, we have to tryto find a clue."Hoyt looked dubious but nodded. In the end, there was little invasionof privacy. Masteen's first trunk held only a few changes of linen anda copy of Muir's Book of Life. The second bag held a hundred separatelywrapped seedlings, flash-dried and nestled in moist soil.'Templars must plant at least a hundred offspring of the Eternal Tree onwhatever. world they visit,' explained the Consul. 'The shoots rarelytake, but it's a ritual."Browne Lamia moved toward the large metal box which had sat at thebottom of the pile.'Don't touch that!" snapped the Consul.'Why not?"'It's a MObius cube,' responded Colonel Kassad for the Consul. 'Acarbon-carbon-shell set around a zero impedance containment field foldedback on itself."'So?" said Lamia. 'MObius cubes seal artifacts and stuff in. Theydon't explode or anything."'No,' agreed the Consul, 'but what they contain may explode. Mayalready have exploded, for that matter."'A cube that size could hold a kiloton nuclear explosion in check aslong as it was boxed during the nanosecond of ignition,' added FedmahnKassad.Lamia scowled at the trunk. 'Then how do we know that something inthere didn't kill Masteen?"Kassad pointed to a faintly glowing green strip along the trunk's onlyseam. 'It's sealed. Once unsealed, a MObius cube has to be reactivatedat a place where containment fields can be generated. Whatever's inthere didn't harm Captain Masteen."'So there's no way to tell?" mused Lamia.'I have a good guess,' said the Consul.The others looked at him. Rachel began to cry and Sol pulled a heatingstrip on a nursing pak.'Remember,' said the Consul, 'at Edge yesterday when M. Masteen made abig deal out of the cube? Hetalked about it as if it were a secret weapon?"'A weapon?" said Lamia.'Of course!" Kassad said suddenly. 'An erg!''Erg?" Martin Silenus stared at the small crate. 'l thought ergs werethose forcefield critters that Templars use on their treeships."'They are,' said the Consul. 'The things were found about threecenturies ago living on asteroids around Aldebaran. Bodies about as bigas a cat's spine, mostly a piezoelectric nervous system sheathed insilicon gristle, but they feed on... and manipulate... forcefields aslarge as those generated by small spinships."'So how do you get all that into such a little box?" asked Silenus,staring at the MObius cube. 'Mirrors?"'In a sense,' said Kassad. 'The thing's field would be damped ...neither starving nor feeding. Rather like cryogenic fugue for us. Plusthis must be a small one. A cub, so to speak."Lamia ran her hand along the metal sheath. 'Templars control thesethings? Communicate with them?"'Yes,' said Kassad. 'No one is quite sure how. It's one of theBrotherhood secrets. But Het Masteen must have been confident that theerg would help him with..."'The Shrike,' finished Martin Silenus. 'The Templar thought that thisenergy imp would be his secret weapon when he faced the Lord of Pain."The poet laughed.Father Hoyt cleared his throat. 'The Church has accepted the Hegemony'sruling that... these creatures .. ergs... are not sentient beings...and thus not candidates for salvation."'Oh, they're sentient, all right, Father,' said the Consul.'They perceive things far better than we could ever imagine. But if youmeant intelligent... self-aware...then you're dealing with something along the lines of a smartgrasshopper. Are grasshoppers candidates for salvation?"Hoyt said nothing. Brawne Lamia said, 'Well, evidently Captain Masteenthought this thing was going to be his salvation. Something wentwrong." She looked around at the bloodstained bulkheads and at thedrying stains on the deck. 'Let's get out of here."The windwagon tacked into increasingly strong winds as the stormapproached from the northeast. Ragged banners of clouds raced whitebeneath the low, gray ceiling of stormfront. Grasses whipped and bentunder gusts of cold wind. Ripples of lightning illuminated the horizonand were followed by rolls of thunder sounding like warning shots acrossthe windwagon's bow. The pilgrims watched in silence until the firsticy raindrops drove them below to the large stateroom in the stern.'This was in his robe pocket,' said Brawne Lamia, holding up a slip ofpaper with the number $ on it.'So Masteen would have told his story next,' muttered the Consul.Martin Silenus tilted his chair until his back touched the tall windows.Storm light made his satyr's features appear slightly demonic. 'There'sanother possibility,' he said. 'Perhaps someone who hasn't spoken yethad the fifth spot and killed the Templar to trade places."Lamia stared at the poet. 'That would have to be theConsul or me,' she said, her voice flat.Silenus shrugged.Brawne Lamia pulled another piece of paper from her tunic. 'I havenumber six. What would I have achieved? I go next anyway."'Then perhaps it's what Masteen would have said that needed to besilenced,' said the poet. He shrugged again.'Personally, I think the Shrike has begun harvesting us.Why did we think we'd be allowed to get to the Tombs when the thing'sbeen slaughtering people halfway from here to Keats?"'This is different,' said Sol Weintraub. 'This is theShrike Pilgrimage.",So?,In the silence that followed, the Consul walked to the windows.Wind-driven torrents of rain obscured the Sea and rattled the leadedpanes. The wagon creaked and leaned heavily to starboard as it begananother leg of its tack.'M. Lamia,' asked Colonel Kassad, 'do you want to tell your story now?"Lamia folded her arms and looked at the rain-streaked glass. 'No. Let'swait until we get off this damned ship. It stinks of death."The windwagon reached the port of Pilgrims' Rest in midafternoon but thestorm and tired light made it feellike late evening to the weary passengers. The Consul had expectedrepresentatives from the Shrike Temple to meet them here at thebeginning of the penultimate stage of their journey but Pilgrims' Restappeared to the Consul to be as empty as Edge had been.The approach to the foothills and the first sight of the Bridle Rangewas as exciting as any !andfall and brought all six of the would-bepilgrims on deck despite the cold rain which continued to fall. Thefoothills were sere and sensuous, their brown curves and suddenupthrustings contrasting strongly with the verdant monochrome of the Seaof Grass. The nine-thousand-meter peaks beyond were only hinted at bygray and white planes soon intersected by low clouds, but even sotruncated were powerful to behold. The snow line came down to a pointjust above the collection of burned-out hovels and cheap hotels whichhad been Pilgrims' Rest.'If they destroyed the tramway, we're finished,' muttered the Consul.The thought of it, forbidden until now, made his stomach turn over.'I see the first five towers,' said Colonel Kassad, usinghis powered glasses. 'They seem intact."'Any sign of a car?"'No... wait, yes. There's one in the gate at the station platform."'Any moving?" asked Martin Silenus, who obviously understood howdesperate their situation would be if thetramway was not intact.'No."The Consul shook his head. Even in the worst weather with nopassengers, the cars had been kept moving to keep the great cablesflexed and free of ice.The six of them had their luggage on deck even before the windwagonreefed its sails and extended a gangplank.Each now wore a heavy coat against the elements - Kassad in FORCE-issuethermouflage cape, Brawne Lamia in a long garment called a trenchcoatfor reasons long forgotten, Martin Silenus in thick furs which ripplednow sable, now gray with the vagaries of wind, Father Hoyt in long blackwhich made him more of a scarecrow figure than ever, Sol Weintraub in athickgoosedown jacket which covered him and the child, and the Consul in thethinning but serviceable greatcoat his wife had given him some decadesbefore.'What about Captain Masteen's things?" asked Sol as they stood at thehead of the gangplank. Kassad had gone ahead to reconnoiter thevillage.'I brought them up,' said Lamia. 'We'll take them with us."'It doesn't seem right somehow,' said Father Hoyt.'Just going on, I mean. There should be some... service.Some recognition that a man has died."'May have died,' reminded Lamia, easily lifting a forty-kilo backpackwith one hand.Hoyt looked incredulous. 'Do you really believe that M. Masteen mightbe alive?"'No,' said Lamia. Snowflakes settled on her black hair.Kassad waved to them from the end of the dock and they carried theirluggage off the silent windwagon. No one looked back.'Empty?" called Lamia as they approached the Colonel.The tall man's cloak was still fading from its grayand black chameleon mode.'Empty." 'Bodies?"'No,' said Kassad. He turned toward Sol and the Con sul. 'Did you getthe things from the galley?"Both men nodded.'What things?" asked Silenus.'A week's worth of food,' said Kassad, turning to look up the hilltoward the tramway station. For the first time the Consul noticed thelong assault weapon in the crook of the Colonel's arm, barely visibleunder the cloak.'We're not sure if there are any provisions beyond this point."Will we be alive a week from now? thought the Consul.He said nothing.They ferried the gear to the station in two trips. Wind whistledthrough the open windows and shattered domes of the dark buildings. Onthe second trip, the Consul carried one end of Masteen's M6bius cubewhile Lunar Hoyt puffed and panted under the other end.'Why are we taking the erg thing with us?" gasped Hoyt as they reachedthe base of the metal stairway leading to the station. Rust streakedand spotted the platform like orange lichen.'I don't know,' said the Consul, gasping for breath himself.From the terminal platform they could see far out over the Sea of Grass.The windwagon sat where they had left it, sails reefed, a dark andlifeless thing. Snow squalls moved across the prairie and gave theillusion of whitecaps on the numberless stalks of high grass.'Get the material aboard,' called Kassad. 'I'11 see if the running gearcan be reset from the operator's cabin up there."'Isn't it automatic?" asked Martin Silenus, his small head almost lostin thick furs. 'Like the windwagon?"'I don't think so,' said Kassad. 'Go on, I'll see if I can get itstarted up."'What if it leaves without you?" called Lamia at the Colonel'sretreating back.'It won't."The interior of the tramcar was cold and bare except for metal benchesin the forward compartment and a dozen rough bunks in the smaller, reararea. The car was big -at least eight meters long by five wide. Therear compartment was partitioned from the front cabin by a thin metalbulkhead with an opening but no door. A small commode took up acloset-sized corner of this aft compartment.Windows rising from waist height to the roof-line lined the forwardcompartment.The pilgrims heaped their luggage in the center of the wide floor andstomped around, waved their arms, or otherwise worked to stay warm.Martin Silenus lay full length on one of the benches, with only his feetand the top of his head emerging from fur. '1 forgot,' he said, 'howthe fuck do you turn on the heat in this thing?"The Consul glanced at the dark lighting panels. 'It's electrical. It'llcome on when the Colonel gets us moving."'If the Colonel gets us moving,' said Silenus.Sol Weintraub had changed Rachei's diaper. Now he bundled her up againin an infant's thermsuit and rocked her in his arms. 'Obviously l'venever been here before,'he said. 'Both of you gentlemen have?"'Yeah,' said the poet.'No,' said the Consul. 'But I've seen pictures of the tramway."'Kassad said he returned to Keats once this way,' called Brawne Lamiafrom the other room.'I think ..." began Sol Weintraub and was interrupted by a greatgrinding of gears and a wild lurch as the long car rocked sickeninglyand then swung forward under the suddenly moving cable. Everyone rushedto the window on the platform side.Kassad had thrown his gear aboard before climbing the long ladder to theoperator's cabin. Now he appeared in the cabin's doorway, slid down thelong ladder, and ran toward the car. The car was already passing beyondthe loading area of the platform.'He isn't going to make it,' whispered Father Hoyt.Kassad sprinted the last ten meters with legs that looked impossiblylong, a cartoon stick figure of a mallThe tramcar slid out of the loading notch, swung free of the station.Space opened between the car and the station. It was eight meters tothe rocks below. The platform deck was streaked with ice. Kassad ranfull speed ahead even as the car pulled away.'Come on!" screamed Brawne Lamia. The others picked up the cry.The Consul looked up at sheaths of ice cracking and dropping away fromthe cable as the tramcar moved up and forward. He looked back. Therewas too much space. Kassad could never make it.Fedmahn Kassad was moving at an incredible speed when he reached theedge of the platform. The Consul was reminded for the second time ofthe Old Earth jaguar he had seen in a Lusus zoo. He half expected tosee the Colone!'s feet slip on a patch of ice, the long legs flying outhorizontal, the man failing silently to the snowy boulders below.Instead, Kassad seemed to fly foran endless moment, long arms extended, cape flying out behind. Hedisappeared behind the car.There came a thud, followed by a long minute when no one spoke or moved.They were forty meters high now, climbing toward the first tower. Asecond later Kassad became visible at the corner of the car, pullinghimself along a series of icy niches and handholds in the metal.Brawne Lamia flung open the cabin door. Ten hands helped pull Kassadinside.'Thank God,' said Father Hoyt.The Colonel took a deep breath and smiled grimly.'There was a dead man's brake. I had to rig the lever with a sandbag. Ididn't want to bring the car back for a second try."Martin Silenus pointed to the rapidly approaching support tower and theceiling of clouds just beyond. The cable stretched upward intooblivion. 'I guess we'recrossing the mountains now whether we want to or not." 'How long to makethe crossing?" asked Hoyt.'Twelve hours. A little less perhaps. Sometimes the operators wouldstop the cars if the wind rose too high or the ice got too bad."'We won't be stopping on this trip,' said Kassad.'Unless the cable's breached somewhere,' said the poet. 'Or we hit asnag."'Shut up,' said Lamia. 'Who's interested in heating some dinner?"'Look,' said the Consul.They moved to the forward windows. The tram rose a hundred meters abovethe last brown curve of foothills.Kilometers below and behind they caught a final glimpse of the station,the haunted hovels of Pilgrims' Rest, and the motionless windwagon.Then snow and thick cloud enveloped them.The tramcar had no real cooking facilities but the aft bulkhead offereda cold box and a microwave for reheating. Lamia and Weintraub combinedvarious meats and vegetables from the windwagon's galley to produce apassable stew. Martin Silenus had brought along wine bottles from theBenares and the windwagonand he chose a Hyperion burgundy to go with the stew.They were nearly finished with their dinner when the gloom pressingagainst the windows lightened and then lifted altogether. The Consulturned on his bench to see the sun suddenly reappear, filling thetramcar with a transcendent golden light.There was a collective sigh from the group. It had seemed that darknesshad fallen hours before, but now, as they rose above a sea of cloudsfrom which rose an island chain of mountains, they were treated to abrilliant sunset. Hyperion's sky had deepened from its daytime glaucousglare to the bottomless lapis !azuli of evening while a red-gold sunignited cloud towers and great summits of ice and rock. The Consullooked around. His fellow pilgrims, who had seemed gray and small inthe dim light of half a minute earlier, now glowed in the gold ofsunset.Martin Silenus raised his glass. 'That's better, by God."The Consul looked up at their line of travel, the massive cabledwindling to threadlike thinness far ahead and then to nothing at all.On a summit several kilometers beyond, gold light glinted on the nextsupport tower.'One hundred and ninety-two pylons,' said Silenus in a singsong tourguide's bored tones. 'Each pylon is constructed of duralloy andwhiskered carbon and stands eighty-three meters high."'We must be high,' said Brawne Lamia in a low voice.'The high point of the ninety-six-kilometer tramcar voyage lies abovethe summit of Mount Dryden, the fifth highest peak in the Bridle Range,at nine thousand two hundred forty-six meters,' droned on MartinSilenus.Colonel Kassad looked around. 'The cabin's pressur ized. I felt thechange-over some time ago."'Look,' said Brawne Lamia.The sun had been resting on the horizon line of clouds for a longmoment. Now it dipped below, seemingly igniting the depths of stormcloud from beneath and casting a panoply of colors along the entirewestern edge of the world. Snow cornices and glaze ice still glowedalong the western side of the peaks, which rose akilometer or more above the rising tramcar. A few brighter starsappeared in the deepening dome of sky.The Consul turned to Brawne Lamia. 'Why don't you tell your story now,M. Lamia? We'll want to sleep later, before arriving at the Keep."Lamia sipped the last of her wine. 'Does everyone want to hear it now?"Heads nodded in the roseate twilight. Martin Silenus shrugged.'All right,' said Brawne Lamia. She set down her empty glass, pulledher feet up on the bench so that her elbows rested on her knees, andbegan her tale.THE DETECTIVE'S TALE: The Long Good-ByeI knew the case was going to be special the minute that he walked intomy office. He was beautiful. By that I don't mean effeminate or'pretty' in the male-model, HTV-star mode, merely... beautiful.He was a short man, no taller than I, and I was born and raised inLusus's 1.3-g field. It was apparent in a second that my visitor wasnot from Lusus - his compact form was well proportioned by Webstandards, athletic but thin. His face was a study in purposefulenergy: low brow, sharp cheekbones, compact nose, solid jaw, and a widemouth that suggested both a sensuous side and a stubborn streak. Hiseyes were large and hazel-colored.He looked to be in his late twenties standard.Understand, I didn't itemize all this the moment he walked in. My firstthought was, Is this a client? Mysecond thought was, Shit, this guy'$ beautiful.'M. Lamia?" 'Yeah."'M. Brawne Lamia of AllWeb Investigations?" 'Yeah."He looked around as if he didn't quite believe it. I understood thelook. My office is on the twenty-third level of an old industrial hivein the Old Digs section of Iron Pig on Lusus. I have three big windowsthat lookout on Service Trench 9 where it's always dark and always drizzlingthanks to a massive filter drip from the Hive above. The view is mostlyof abandoned automated loading docks and rusted girders.What the hell, it's cheap. And most of my clients call rather than showup in person.'May I sit down?" he asked, evidently satisfied that a bona fideinvestigatory agency would operate out of such a slum.'Sure,' I said and waved him to a chair. 'M... ah?" 'Johnny,' he said.He didn't look like a first-name type to me. Something about himbreathed money. It wasn't his clothes - common enough casuals in blackand gray, although the fabric was better than average - it was just asense that the guy had class. There was something about his accent.l'm good at placing dialects- it helps in this profession - but Icouldn't place this guy's homeworld, much less local region.'How can I help you, Johnny?" I held out the bottle of Scotch I had beenready to put away as he entered.Johnny-boy shook his head. Maybe he thought 1 wanted him to drink fromthe bottle. Hell, I have more class than that. There are paper cupsover by the water cooler. 'M. Lamia,' he said, the cultivated accentstillbugging me by its elusiveness, 'I need an investigator." 'That's what Ido."He paused. Shy. A lot of my clients are hesitant to tell me what thejob is. No wonder, since ninety-five percent of my work is divorce anddomestic stuff. I waited him out.'It's a somewhat sensitive matter,' he said at last.'Yeah, M . . . ah, Johnny, most of my work falls under that category.I'm bonded with UniWeb and everything having to do with a client fallsunder the Privacy Protection Act. Everything is confidential, even thefact that we're talking now. Even if you decide not to hire me." Thatwas basic bullshit since the authorities could get at my files in amoment if they ever wanted to, but I sensed that I had to put this guyat ease somehow.God, he was beautiful.'Uh-huh,' he said and glanced around again. He leaned forward. 'M.Lamia, I would want you to investigate a murder."This got my attention. I'd been reclining with my feet on the desk; nowI sat up and leaned forward. 'A mur der? Are you sure? What about thecops?"'They aren't involved."'That's not possible,' I said with the sinking feeling that I wasdealing with a loony rather than a client. 'It's a crime to conceal amurder from the authorities." What I thought was: Are you the murderer,Johnny?He smiled and shook his head. 'Not in this case." 'What do you mean?"'1 mean, M. Lamia, that a murder was committed but that the police-local and Hegemony- have neither knowledge of it nor jurisdiction overit."'Not possible,' I said again. Outside, sparks from an industrialwelder's torch cascaded into the trench along with the rusty drizzle.'Explain."'A murder was committed outside of the Web. Outside of theProtectorate. There were no local authorities."That made sense. Sort of. For the life of me, though, I couldn'tfigure where he was talking about. Even the Outback settlements andcolonial worlds have cops. On board some sort of spaceship? Uh-uh. TheInterstellar Transit Authority has jurisdiction there.'I see,' I said. It'd been some weeks since l'd had a case. 'Allright, tell me the details."'And the conversation will be confidential even if youdo not take the case?"'Absolutely."'And if you do take the case, you will report only to me?"'Of course."My prospective client hesitated, rubbing his fingers against his chin.His hands were exquisite. 'All right,' he said at last.'Start at the beginning,' 1 said. 'Who was murdered?"Johnny sat up straight, an attentive schoolboy. There was no doubtinghis sincerity. He said, 'I was."It took ten minutes to get the story out of him. When he was finished,I no longer thought he was crazy. I was. Or I would be if I took thejob.Johnny - his real name was a code of digits, letters, and cipher bandslonger than my arm - was a cybrid.I'd heard about cybrids. Who hasn't? I once accused my first husbandof being one. But I never expected to be sitting in the same room withone. Or to find it so damned attractive.Johnny was an AI. His consciousness or ego or whatever you want to callit floated somewhere in the megadatasphere datumplane of TechnoCore.Like everyone else except maybe the current Senate CEO or the Als'garbage removers, I had no idea where the TechnoCore was. The Als hadpeacefully seceded from human control more than three centuries ago -before my time- and while they continued to serve the Hegemony as alliesby advising the All Thing, monitoring the dataspheres, occasionallyusing their predictive abilities to help us avoid major mistakes ornatural disasters, the TechnoCore generally went about its ownindecipherable and distinctly nonhuman business in privacy.Fair enough, it seemed to me.Usually Als do business with humans and human machines via thedatasphere. They can manufacture an interactive holo if they need to -I remembered during the Maui-Covenant incorporation, the TechnoCoreambassadors at the treaty signing looked suspiciously like the old holostar Tyrone Bathwaite.Cybrids are a whole different matter. Tailored from human geneticstock, they are far more human in appearance and outward behavior thanandroids are allowed to be. Agreements between the TechnoCore and theHegemony allow only a handful of cybrids to be in existence.I looked at Johnny. Fom an AI's perspective, the beautiful body andintriguing personality sitting across the desk from me must be merelyanother appendage, a remote, somewhat more complex but otherwise no moreimportant than any one of ten thousand such sensors, manipulators,autonomous units, or other remotes that an AI might use in a day's work.Discarding 'Johnny' probably would create no more concern in an AI thanclip ping a fingernail would bother me.What a waste, I thought.'A cybrid,' I said.'Yes. Licensed. I have a Worldweb user's visa."'Good,' I heard myself say. 'And someone... murdered your cybrid andyou want me to f'md out who?"'No,' said the young man. He had brownish-red curls.Like his accent, the hairstyle eluded me. It seemed archaic somehow,but I had seen it somewhere. 'It was not merelythis body that was murdered. My assailant murdered me." 'You?" 'Yes."'You as in the... ah... AI itself?."'Precisely."I didn't get it. Als can't die. Not as far as anyone in the Web knew.'I don't get it,' I said.Johnny nodded, 'Unlike a human personality which can . . . I believethe consensus is . . . be destroyed at death, my own consciousnesscannot be terminated.There was, however, as a result of the assault, an...interruption. Although I possessed... ah... shall we say duplicaterecordings of memories, personality, et cetera, there was a loss. Somedata were destroyed in the attack. In that sense, the assailantcommitted murder."'I see,' I lied. I took a breath. 'What about the AI authorities ...if there are such things ... or the Hegemony cybercops? Wouldn't theybe the ones to go tO?"'For personal reasons,' said the attractive young man whom I was tryingto see as a cybrid, 'it is important - even necessary - that I do notconsult these sources."I raised an eyebrow. This sounded more like one of my regular clients.'I assure you,' he said, 'it is nothing illegal. Nor unethical. Merely. . . embarrassing to me on a level which I cannot explain."I folded my arms across my chest. 'Look, Johnny.This is a pretty half-assed story. I mean, I only have your word thatyou're a cybrid. You might be a scam artist for all I know."He looked surprised. 'I had not thought of that. How would you like meto show you that I am what I say I am?"I did not hesitate a second. 'Transfer a million marks to my checkingaccount in TransWeb,' I said.Johnny smiled. At the same instant my phone rang and the image of aharried man with the TransWeb code block floating behind him said,'Excuse me, M. Lamia, but we wondered with a... ah... deposit of thissize if you would be interested in investigating our long-term savingsoptions or our mutual assured market possibilities?"'Later,' I said.The bank manager nodded and vanished.'That could've been a simulation,' I said.Johnny's smile was pleasant. 'Yes, but even thatwould be a satisfactory demonstration, would it not?" 'Not necessarily."He shrugged. 'Assuming I am what I say I am, will you take the case?"'Yeah." I sighed. 'One thing though. My fee isn't a million marks. Iget five hundred a day plus expenses."The cybrid nodded. 'Does that mean you will take the case?"I stood up, put on my hat, and pulled an old coat from a rack by thewindow. I bent over the lower desk drawer, smoothly sliding my father'spistol into a coat pocket.'Let's go,' I said.'Yes,' said Johnny. 'Go where?"'I want to see where you were murdered."Stereotype has it' that someone born on Lusus hates to leave the Hiveand suffers from instant agoraphobia if we visit anything more open tothe elements that a shopping mall. The truth of it is, most of mybusiness comes from ... and leads to ... offworld. Skiptracingdeadbeats who use the farcaster system and a change ofidentity to try to start over. Finding philandering spouses who thinkrendezvousing on a different planet will keep them safe from discovery.Tracking down missing kids and absent parents.Still, I was surprised to the point of hesitating a second when westepped through the Iron Pig Concourse far-caster onto an empty stoneplateau which seemed to stretch to infinity. Except for the bronzerectangle of the farcaster portal behind us, there was no sign ofcivilization anywhere. The air smelled like rotten eggs. The sky was ayellow-brown cauldron of sick-looking clouds.The ground around us was gray and scaled and held no visible life, noteven lichen. I had no idea how far away the horizon really was, but wefelt high and it looked far, and there was no hint of trees, shrubs, oranimal life in the distance either.'Where the hell are we?" I asked. I had been sure that I knew all ofthe worlds in the Web.'Madhya,' said Johnny, pronouncing it something like 'Mudye."'I never heard of it,' I said, putting one hand in my pocket and findingthe pearl-handled grip of Dad's automatic.'It's not officially in the Web yet,' said the cybrid.'Officially it's a colony of Parvati. But it's only light-minutes fromthe FORCE base there and the farcaster connections have been set upbefore Madhya joins the Protectorate."I looked at the desolation. The hydrogen-sulfide stench was making meill and I was afraid it was going to ruin my suit. 'Colonies? Nearby?"'No. There are several small cities on the other side of the planet."'What's the nearest inhabited area?"'N.nda Devi. A town of about three hundred people.It's more than two thousand kilometers to the south." 'Then why put afarcaster portal here?"'Potential mining sites,' said Johnny. He gestured toward the grayplateau. 'Heavy metals. The consortium authorized over a hundredfarcaster portals in this hemisphere for easy access once thedevelopment began."'Okay,' ! said. 'It's a good place for a murder. Why'd you comehere?"' I don't know. It was part of the memory section lost." 'Who'd youcome with?" 'I don't know that either." 'What do you know?"The young man put his graceful hands in his pockets.'Whoever... whatever... attacked me used a type ofweapon known in the Core as an AIDS II virus." 'What'sthat?"'AIDS II was a human plague disease back long before the Hegira,' saidJohnny." It disabled the immune system.This... virus... worksthesamewith anal. Inlessthana second itinfiltrates security systems and turns lethal phagocyte programs againstthe host... against the AI itself. Against me."'So you couldn't have contracted this virus naturally?" Johnny smiled.'Impossible. l?s comparable to asking a shooting victim if he might nothave fallen on the bullets."I shrugged." Look, if you want a datumnet or AI expert, you've come tothe wrong woman. Other than accessing the sphere like twenty billionother chumps, I know zilch about the ghost world." I used the old termto see if it would get a rise out of him.'I know,' said Johnny, still equable. 'That's not what I want you todo."'What do you want me to do?"'Find out who brought me here and killed me. And why."'All right. Why do you think this is where the murder took place?"'Because this is where I regained control of my cybrid when I was...reconstituted."'You mean your cybrid was incapacitated while thevirus destroyed you?"'Yes."'And how long did that last?"'My death? Almost a minute before my reserve persona could beactivated."I laughed. I couldn't help myself.'What is amusing, M. Lamia?"'Your concept of death,' I said.The hazel eyes looked sad. 'Perhaps it is amusing to you, but you haveno idea what a minute of... disconnection...means to an element of the TechnoCore.It is eons of time and information. Millennia of non-communication."'Yeah,' I said, able to hold back my own tears without too much effort.'So what did your body, your cybrid dowhile you were changing personae tapes or whatever?" '1 presume it wascomatose."'It can't handle itself autonomously?"'Oh, yes, but not when there's a general systems failure."'So where did you come to?"'Pardon me?"'When you reactivated the cybrid, where was it?" Johnny nodded inunderstanding. He pointed to a boulder less than five meters from thefarcaster. 'Lying there."'Oh this side or the other side?"'The other side."I went over and examined the spot. No blood. No notes. No murderweapons left lying about. Not even a footprint or indication thatJohnny's body had lain there for that eternity of a minute. A policeforensics team might have read volumes into the microscopic and bioticclues left there, but all I could see was hard rock.'If your memory's really gone,' I said, 'how do youknow someone else came here with you?"'I accessed the farcaster records."'Did you bother to check the mystery person or person's name on theuniversal card charge?"'We both farcast on my card,' said Johnny.'Just one other person?" 'Yes."I nodded. Farcaster records would solve every inter-world crime if theportals were true teleportation; the transport data record could havere-created the subject down to the last gram and follicle. Instead, afarcaster essentially is just a crude hole ripped in space/time by aphased singularity. If the farcaster criminal doesn't usehis or her own card, the only data we get are origination anddestination.'Where'd you two farcast from?" I asked.'Tau Ceti Center."'You have the portal code?"'Of course."'Let's go there and finish this conversation,' I said.'This place stinks to high heaven."TC, the age-old nickname for Tau Ceti Center, is certainly the mostcrowded world in the Web. Besides its population of five billion peoplescrabbling for room on less than half the land area of Old Earth, it hasan orbital ring ecology that is home for half a billion more. Inaddition to being the capital of the Hegemony and home of the Senate,TC2 is the business nexus for Webtrade.Naturally the portal number Johnny had found brought us to asix-hundred-portal terminex in one of the biggest spires in New London,one of the oldest and largest city sections.'Hell,' I said, 'let's get a drink."There was a choice of bars near the terminex and I picked one that wasrelatively quiet: a simulated 'ship's tavern, dark, cool, with plenty offake wood and brass. I ordered a beer. I never drink the hard stuff oruse Flashback when on a case. Sometimes I think that need forself-discipline is what keeps me in the business.Johnny also ordered a beer, a dark, German brew bottled on RenaissanceVector. I found myself wondering what vices a cybrid might have. Isaid:'What else did you find out before coming to see me?" The young manopened his hands. 'Nothing."'Shit,' I said reverently. 'This is a joke. With all the powers of anAI at your disposal, you can't trace your cybrid's whereabouts andactions for a few days prior to your... accident?"'No." Johnny sipped his beer. 'Rather, I could but there are importantreasons why I. do not want my fellow Als to find me investigating."'You suspect one of them?"Instead of answering, Johnny handed me a flimsy of his universal cardpurchases. 'The blackout caused by my murder left five standard daysunaccounted for.Here are the card charges for that time."'I thought you said you were only disconnected for a minute."Johnny scratched his cheek with one finger. 'I was lucky to lose onlyfive days' worth of data,' he said.I waved over the human waiter and ordered another beer. 'Look,' I said,'Johnny... whoever you are, VII never be able to get an angle on thiscase unless I know more about you and your situation. Why would someonewant to kill you if they know you'll be reconstituted or whatever thehell it is?"'I see two possible motives,' said Johnny over his beer.I nodded. 'One would be to create just the memory loss they succeededin getting,' I said. 'That would suggest that, whatever it was theywanted you to forget, it'd occurred or come to your attention in thepast week or so. What's the second motive?"'To send me a message,' said Johnny. '1 just don't know what it is. Orfrom whom."'Do you know who would want to kill you?"'No."'No guesses at all?"'None."'Most murders,' I said, 'are acts of sudden, mindless rage committed bysomeone the victim knows well.Family. A friend or lover. A majority of the premeditated ones areusually carried out by someone close to the victim."Johnny said nothing. There was something about his face that I foundincredibly attractive - a sort of masculine strength combined with afeminine sense of awareness.Perhaps it was the eyes.'Do Als have families?" I asked. 'Feuds? Squabbles?Lovers' spats?"'No." He smiled slightly. 'There are quasi-family arrangements, butthey share none of the requirements of emotion or responsibility thathuman families exhibit.AI "families" are primarily convenient code groups for showing wherecertain processing trends originated."350.'So you don't think another AI attacked you?"'It's possible." Johnny rotated his glass in his hands. 'I just do notsee why they would attack me through my cybrid."'Easier access?"'Perhaps But it complicates things for the assailant.An attack in datumplane would have been infinitely more lethal. Also, Ido fail to see any motive for another AI. It makes no sense. I'm athreat to no one."'Why do you have a cybrid, Johnny? Maybe if I understood your role inthings, I could get a motive'He picked up a pretzel and played with it. 'I have a cybrid... in someways I am a cybrid, because my...function... is to observe and react to human beings. In a sense, I washuman once myself."I frowned and shook my head. So far nothing he'd said had made sense'You've heard of personality retrieval projects?" he asked.'No."'A standard year ago, when the FORCE sims re-created the personality ofGeneral Horace Glennon-Height to see what made him such a brilliantgeneral? It was in allthe news''Yeah."'Well, I am... or was... an earlier and much more complicatedretrieval project. My core persona was based on a pre-Hegira Old Earthpoet. Ancient. Born late eighteenth century Old Calendar."'How the hell can they reconstruct a personality that lost in time?"'Writings,' said Johnny 'His letters. Diaries. Critical biographies.Testimony of friends. But mostly through his verse. The sim re-createsthe environment, plugs in the known factors, and works backward from thecreative products. Voild - a persona core. Crude at first but, by thetime I came into being, relatively refined. Our first attempt was atwentieth-century poet named Ezra Pound. Our persona was opinionated tothe point of absurdity, prejudiced beyond rationality, and functionallyinsane. It took a year of tinkering before wediscovered that the persona was accurate; it was the man who had beennuts. A genius but nuts''And then what?" I said. 'They build your personality around a deadpoet. Then what?"'This becomes the template upon which the AI is grown,' said Johnny.'The cybrid allows me to carry outmy role in the datumplane community."'As poet?"Johnny smiled again. 'More as poem,' he said.'A poem?"'An ongoing work of art... but not in the human sense A puzzleperhaps. A variable enigma which occasionally offers unusual insightsinto more serious lines of analysis."'I don't get it,' I said.'It probably does not matter. I very much doubt if my . . purpose... was the cause of the assault' 'What do you thinkwas the cause?" 'I have no idea."I felt us closing a circle. 'All right,' I said. 'I'11 try to find outwhat you were doing and who you were with during these lost five days.Is there anything besides the credit flimsy that you can think of tohelp?"Johnny shook his head. 'You know, of course, why it is important for meto know the identity and motive of my assailant?"'Sure,' I said, 'they might try it again."'Precisely."'How can I get hold of you if I need to?" Johnny passed me an accesschip.'A secure line?" ! said.' Very. ''Okay,' I said, 'I'11 get back to you if and when I get someinformation."We moved out of the bar and toward the terminex. He was moving awaywhen I took three quick steps and grabbed his arm. It was the firsttime that I had touched him. 'Johnny. What's the name of the Old Earthpoetthey resurrected..."'Retrieved."'Whatever. The one they built your AI persona on?"The attractive cybrid hesitated. 1 noticed that his eyelashes were verylong. 'How can it be important?" he asked.'Who knows what's important?"He nodded. 'Keats,' he said. 'Born in A.D. 1795. Died oftuberculosis in 1821. John Keats."Following someone through a series of farcaster changes is damn nearimpossible. Especially if you want to remain undetected. The Web copscan do it, given about fifty agents assigned to the task, plus someexotic and damned expensive high-tech toys, not to mention thecooperation of the Transit Authority. For a solo, the task is almostimpossible.Still, it was fairly important for me to see where my new client washeaded.Johnny did not look back as he crossed the terminex plaza. I moved to anearby kiosk and watched through my pocket-sized imager as he punchedcodes on a manual diskey, inserted his card, and stepped through theglowing rectangle.The use of the manual diskey probably meant that he was headed for ageneral access portal since private 'caster codes are usually imprintedon eyes-only chips.Great. I'd narrowed his destination down to approximately two millionportals on a hundred and fifty-some Web worlds and half that many moons.With one hand I pulled the red 'lining' out of my overcoat while I hitreplay on the imager, watching through the eyepiece as it magnified thediskey sequence.I tugged out a red cap to go with my new red jacket and pulled the brimlow over my face. Moving quickly across the plaza, I queried my comlogabout the nine-digit transfer code I'd seen on the imager. I knew thefirst three digits meant the world of Tsingtao-Hsishuang Parma -I'dmemorized all the planetary prefixes - and was told an instant laterthat the portal code led to a residential district in the FirstExpansion city of Wansiehn.I hurried to the first open booth and 'cast there, stepping out onto asmall terminex plaza paved in worn brick. Ancient oriental shops leanedagainst oneanother, caves of their pagoda roofs hanging over narrow side streets.People thronged the plaza and stood in doorways and, while most of thosein sight were obviously descendants of the Long Flight exiles whosettled THP, many were offworlders. The air smelled of alienvegetation, sewage, and cooking rice.'Damn,' I whispered. There were three other farcaster portals there andnone were in constant use. Johnny could have farcast out immediately.Instead of 'casting back to Lusus, I spent a few minutes checking theplaza and side streets. By this time the melanin pill I'd swallowed hadworked and I was a young black woman - or man, it was hard to tell in mytrendy red balloon jacket and polarized visor, strolling idly whiletaking pictures with my tourist imager.The trace pellet I'd dissolved in Johnny's second German beer had hadmore than enough time to work. The UV-positive microspores were almosthanging in the air by now - I could almost follow the trail ofexhalations he had left. Instead, I found a bright yellow handprint ona dark wall (bright yellow to my especially fitted visor of course,invisible out of the UV spectrum) and then followed the trail of vagueblotches where saturated clothing had touched market stalls or stone.Johnny was eating in a Cantonese restaurant less than two blocks fromthe terminex plaza. The frying food smelled delicious but I restrainedmyself from entering - checking prices in alley bookstalls and hagglingin the market for almost an hour before he finished, returned to theplaza, and farcast out. This time he used a chip code - a privateportal, certainly, possibly a private home - and I two took chances byusing my pilot-fish card to follow him. Two chances because first thecard is totally illegal and would someday cost me my license if caught -less than likely if I kept using Daddy Silva's obscenely expensive butaesthetically perfect shapechanger chips - and, second, I ran a betterthan even chance of ending up in the living room of Johnny's house ...never an easy situation to talk one's way out of.It was not his living room. Even before I'd located thestreet signs I recognized the familiar extra tug of gravity, the dim,bronze light, the scent of oil and ozone in the air, and knew I was homeon Lusus.Johnny had 'cast into a medium-security private residential tower in oneof the Bergson Hives. Perhaps that was why he'd chosen my agency- wewere almost neighbors, less than six hundred klicks apart.My cybrid was not in sight. I walked purposefully so as not to alertany security vids programmed to respond to loitering. There was noresidents' directory, no numbers or names on the apartment doorways, andno listings accessible by comlog. I guessed that there were abouttwenty thousand residential cubbies in East Bergson Hive.The telltales were fading as the spore soup died, but 1 checked only twoof the radial corridors before I found a trail. Johnny lived far out ona glass-floored wing above a methane lake. His palmlock showed afaintly glowing handprint. I used my cat-burglar tools to take areading of the lock and then I 'cast home.All in all, I'd watched my man go out for Chinese food and then go homefor the night. Enough accomplished for one day.BB Surbringer was my Al expert. BB worked in Hegemony Flow ControlRecords and Statistics and spent most of his life reclining on afree-fall couch with half a dozen microleads running from his skullwhile he communed with other bureaucrats in datumplane. I'd known himin college when he was a pure cyberpuke, a twentieth-generation hacker,cortically shunted when he was twelve standard. His real name wasErnest but he'd earned the nickname BB when he went out with a friend ofmine named Shayla Toyo. Shayla'd seen him naked on their second dateand had laughed for a solid half hour: Ernest was - and is - almost twometers tall but masses less than fifty kilos. Shayla said that he had abutt like two BBs and - like most cruel things do - the nickname stuck.I visited him in one of the windowless worker monoliths on TC2. Nocloud towers for BB and his ilk.'So, Brawne,' he said, 'how come you're getting information-literate inyour old age? You're too old to get a real job."'I just want to know about-Als, BB."'Only one of the most complex topics in the known universe,' he sighedand looked longingly at his disconnected neural shunt and metacortexleads.Cyberpukes never come down, but civil servants are required to dismountfor lunch. BB was like most cyberpukes in that he never feltcomfortable exchanging information when he wasn't riding a data wave.'So what do you want to know?" he said.'Why did the Als drop out?" I had to start somewhere.BB made a convoluted gesture with his hands. 'They said they hadprojects which were not compatible with total immersion in Hegemony -read human - affairs.Truth is, nobody knows."'But they're still around. Still managing things?" 'Sure. The systemcouldn't run without them. You know that, Brawne. Even the All Thingcouldn't work without AI management of the real-time Schwarzschildpatterning..."'Okay,' I said, cutting him off before he lapsed into cyberpukese, 'butwhat are their "other projects"?"'No one knows. Branner and Swayze up at ArtIntel Corp think that theAls are pursuing the evolution of consciousness on a galactic scale. Weknow they have their own probes out far deeper into the Outback than..."'What about cybrids?"'Cybrids?" BB sat up and looked interested for the first time. 'Why doyou mention cybrids?"'Why are you surprised that I mentioned them, BB?" He absently rubbedhis shunt socket. 'Well, first of all, most people forget they exist.Two centuries ago it was all alarmism and pod people taking over and allthat, but now nobody thinks about them. Also, I just ran across ananomaly advisory yesterday that said that cybrids were disappearing."'Disappearing?" It was my turn to sit up.'You know, being phased out. The Als used to maintainabout a thousand licensed cybrids in the Web. About half of them basedright here on TC2. Last week's census showed about two thirds ofthose'd been recalled in the past month or so."'What happens when an AI recalls its cybrid?"'I dunno. They're destroyed, I suppose. AIs don't like to wastethings, so I imagine the genetic material's recycled somehow."'Why are they being recycled?"'Nobody knows, Brawne. But then most of us don'tknow why the AIs do most of the things they do."'Do experts see them - the AIs - as a threat?"'Are you kidding? Six hundred years ago, maybe. Two centuries ago theSecession made us leery. But if the things wanted to hurt humanity,they could're done it long before this. Worrying about Als turning onus is about as productive as worrying that farm animals are going torevolt."'Except the Als are smarter than us,' I said.'Yeah, well, there is that."'BB, have you heard of personality retrieval projects?" 'Like theGlennon-Height thing? Sure. Everyone has.I even worked on one at Reichs University a few yearsago. But they're passe. No one's doing them anymore." 'Why's that?"'Jesus, you don't know shit about anything, do you, Brawne? Thepersonality retrieval projects were all washouts. Even with the bestsim control... they got the FORCE OCS:HTN network involved... youcan't factor all variables successfully. The persona template becomesself-aware . . . I don't mean just self-aware, like you and me, butself-aware that it's an artificially self-aware persona - and that leadsto terminal Strange Loops and nonharmonic labyrinths that go straight toEscher-space."'Translate,' I said.BB sighed and glanced at the blue and gold time band on the wall. Fiveminutes and his mandatory lunch hour was over. He could rejoin the realworld. 'Translated,' he said, 'the retrieved personality breaks down.Goes crazy. Psycho City. Bugfuck."'All of them?"'All of them."'But the Als are still interested in the process?"'Oh, yeah? Who says? They've never done one. All the retrievalefforts I've ever heard of were human-run...mostly botched university projects. Brain-dead academics spendingfortunes to bring back dead academic brains."I forced a smile. 'There were three minutes until he could plug backin. 'Were all the retrieved personalities given cybrid remotes?"'Uh-uh. What gave you that idea, Brawne? Nonewere. Couldn't work."'Why not?"'It'd just fuck up the stimsim. Plus you'd need perfect clone stock andan interactive environment precise to the last detail. You see, kiddo,with a retrieved personality, you let it live in its world viafull-scale sim and then you just sneaked a few questions in via dreamsor scenario interactives. Pulling a persona out of sim reality intoslow time..."This was the cyberpukes' age-old term for the . . .pardon the expression... real world.'... would just drive it bugfuck all the sooner,' he finished.I shook my head. 'Yeah, well, thanks, BB." I moved to the door. Therewere thirty seconds left before my old college friend could escape fromslow time.'BB,' I said as an afterthought, 'have you ever heard of a personaretrieved from an Old Earth poet named John Keats?"'Keats? Oh, sure there was a big write-up on that in my undergrad text.Marti Carollus did that about fifty yearsago at New Cambridge."'What happened?"'The usual. Persona went Strange Loop. But before it broke up it dieda full sim death. Some ancient disease." BB glanced at the clock,smiled, and lifted his shunt.Before clicking it into his skull socket he looked at me again, almostbeatifically. 'I remember now,' he said through his dreamy smile, 'itwas tuberculosis."If our society ever opted for Orwell's Big Brother approach, theinstrument of choice for oppression would have to be the credit wake. Ina totally noncash economy with only a vestigial barter black market, aperson's activities could be tracked in real time by monitoring thecredit wake of his or her universal card. There were strict lawsprotecting card privacy but laws had a bad habit of being ignored orabrogated when societal push came to totalitarian shove.Johnny's credit wake for the five-day period leading to his murdershowed a man of regular habits and modest expenses. Before following upthe leads on the credit flimsy l'd spent a dull two days followingJohnny himself.Data: He lived alone in East Bergson Hive. A routine check showed thathe'd lived there about seven local months - less than five standard. Inthe morning he had breakfast at a local cafe and then farcast toRenaissance Vector where he worked for about five hours, evidentlygathering research of some sort in the print archives, followed by alight lunch at a courtyard vendor's stand, another hour or two in thelibrary, and then 'cast home to Lusus or to some favorite eating spot onanother world. In his cubby by 2200 hours. More farcasting than theaverage Lusian middle-class drone, but an otherwise uninspiringschedule. The credit flimsies confirmed that he had held to the agendaon the week he was murdered, with the addition of a few extra purchases- shoes one day, groceries the next - and one stop at a bar onRenaissance V on the day of his 'murder."I joined him for dinner at the small restaurant on Red Dragon Streetnear the Tsingtao-Hsishuang Panna por tal. The food was very hot, veryspicy, and very good.'How is it going,' he asked.'Great. l'm a thousand marks richer than when we met and I found a goodCantonese restaurant."'I'm glad my money is going toward something important."'Speaking of your money... where does it come from?Hanging out in a Renaissance Vector library can't pay much."Johnny raised an eyebrow. 'I live on a small ...inheritance."'Not too small, I hope. I want to be paid."'It will be adequate for our purposes, M. Lamia. Have you discoveredanything of interest?"I shrugged. 'Tell me what you do in that library." 'Can it possibly begermane?" 'Yeah, could be."He looked at me strangely. Something about his eyes made me go weak atthe knees. 'You remind me of someone,' he said softly.'Oh?" From anyone else that line would have been cause for an exit.'Who?" I asked.'A... woman I once knew. Long ago." He brushed fingers across his browas if he were suddenly tired or dizzy.'What was her name?"'Fanny." The word was almost whispered.I knew who he was talking about. John Keats had a fiancce named Fanny.Their love affair had been a series of romantic frustrations whichalmost drove the poet mad. When he died in Italy, alone except for onefellow traveler, feeling abandoned by friends and his lover, Keats hadasked that unopened letters from Fanny and a lock of her hair be buriedwith him.l'd never heard of John Keats before this week; I'd accessed all thisshit with my comlog. I said, 'So what do you do at the library?"The cybrid cleared his throat. 'l'm researching apoem. Searching for fragments of the original." 'Something by Keats?"'Yes."'Wouldn't it be easier to access it?"'Of course. But it is important for me to see the original...to touch it."I thought about that. 'What's the poem about?"He smiled... or at least his lips did. The hazel eyes still seemedtroubled. 'It's called Hyperion. It's difficult to describe what it'sabout. Artistic failure, I suppose.Keats never finished it."I pushed aside my plate and sipped warm tea. 'You sayKeats never finished it. Don't you mean you never finished it?"His look of shock had to be genuine... unless Als were consummateactors. For all I knew, they could be.'Good God,' he said, 'I'm not John Keats. Having a persona based upon aretrieval template no more makes me Keats than having the name Lamiamakes you a monster.There've been a million influences that have separated me from thatpoor, sad genius."'You said I reminded you of Fanny."'An echo of a dream. Less. You've taken RNA learn ing medication,yes?",yes.,'It's like that. Memories which feel... hollow."A human waiter brought fortune cookies.'Do you have any interest in visiting the realHyperion?" I asked.'What's that?"'The Outback world. Somewhere beyond Parvati, I think."Johnny looked puzzled. He had broken open the cookie but had not yetread the fortune.'It used to be called Poets' World, I think,' I said. 'It even has acity named after you... after Keats."The young man shook his head. 'I'm sorry, I haven't heard of theplace."'How can that be? Don't Als know everything?"His laugh was short and sharp. 'This one knows very little." He readhis fortune: BE WARY OF SUDDEN IMPULSES.I crossed my arms. 'You know, except for that parlor trick with thebank manager holo, I have no proof thatyou are what you say you are." 'Give me your hand." 'My hand?"'Yes. Either one. Thank you."Johnny held my right hand in both of his. His fingerswere longer than mine. Mine were stronger.'Close your eyes,' he said.I did. There was no transition: one instant I was sitting in the BlueLotus on Red Dragon Street and the next Iwas... nowhere. Somewhere. Streaking through gray-blue datumplane,banking along chrome-yellow information highways, passing over and underand titrough great cities of glowing information storage, redskyscrapers sheathed in black security ice, simple entities likepersonal accounts or corporate files blazing like burning refineries inthe night. Above it all, just out of sight as if poised in twistedspace, hung the gigantic weights of the AIs, their simplestcommunications pulsing like violent heat lightning along the infinitehorizons.Somewhere in the distance, all but lost in the maze of three-dimensionalneon that partitioned one tiny second of arc in the incredibledatasphere of one small world, I sensed rather than saw those soft,hazel eyes waiting for me.Johnny released my hand. He cracked my fortune cookie open. The stripof paper read: INVEST WISELY IN NEW VENTURES.'Jesus,' I whispered. BB had taken me flying in datumplane before, butwithout a shunt the experience had been a shadow of this. It was thedifference between watching a black and white holo of fireworks displayand being there. 'How do you do that?"'Will you be making any progress on the case tomorrow?" he asked.I regained my composure. 'Tomorrow,' I said, 'I 101an to solve it."Well, maybe not solve it, but at least get things moving.The last charge on Johnny's credit flimsy had been the bar onRenaissance V. I'd checked it out the first day, of course, talked toseveral of the regulars since there was no human bartender, but had comeup with no one who remembered Johnny. I'd been back twice with nogreater luck. But on the third day I went back to stay until somethingbroke.The bar was definitely not in the class of the wood and brass placeJohnny and I had visited on TC2. This place was tucked on a secondfloor of a decaying building in a run-down neighborhood two blocks fromthe Renaissance library where Johnny spent his days. Not the kindof place he would stop in on the way to the farcaster plaza, but justthe kind of place he might end up if he met someone in or near thelibrary - someone who wanted to talk in private.l'd been there six hours and was getting damned tired of salted nuts andfiat beer when an old derelict came in.I guessed that he was a regular by the way he didn't pause in thedoorway or look around, but headed straight for a small table in the bakand ordered a whiskey before the serving mech had come to a full stop.When I joined him at the table I realized that he wasn't so much aderelict as an example of the tired men and women .I'd seen in the junkshops and street stalls in that neighborhood. Hesquinted up at me through defeated eyes.'May I sit down?"'Depends, sister. What're you selling?"'l'm buying." I sat, set my beer mug on the table, and slid across afiat photo of Johnny entering the farcaster booth on TC2. 'Seen thisguy?"The old man Danced at the photo and returned his full attention to hiswhiskey. 'Maybe."I waved over the mech for another round. 'If you did see him, it's yourlucky day."The old man snoed and rubbed the back of his hand against the graystubble on his cheek. 'If it is, it'll be the first time in a longfucking time." He focused on me.'How much? For what?"'Information. How much depends on the information.Have you seen him?" I removed a black marketfifty-mark bill from my tunic pocket.'eaho'The bill came down to the table but remained in my hand. 'When?"'Last Tuesday. Tuesday morning."That was the correct day. I slid the fifty marks to him and removedanother bill. 'Was he alone?"The old man licked his lips. 'Let me think. I don't think... no, hewas there." He pointed toward a table at the rear. 'Two other guys withhim. One of them...well, that's why I remembered."'What's that?"The old man rubbed finger and thumb in a gesture as old as greed.'Tell me about the two men,' I coaxed.'The young guy... your guy... he was with one of them, you know, thenature freaks with robes. You see'em on HTV all the time. Them andtheir damn trees."Trees? 'A Templar?" I said, astounded. What would a Templar be doingin a Renaissance V bar? If he'd been after Johnny, why would he wearhis robe? That would be like a murderer going out to do business in aclown suit.'Yeah. Templar. Brown robe, sort of oriental-looking." 'A man?"'Yeah, I said he was."'Can you describe him more?"'Nah, Templar. Tall son of a bitch. Couldn't see his face very well."'What about the other one?"The old man shrugged. I removed a second bill and set them both near myglass.'Did they come in together?" I prompted. 'The three of them?"'I don't... I can't... No, wait. Your guy and the Templar guy came infirst. I remember seeing the robebefore the other guy sat down."'Describe the other man."The old man waved over the mech and ordered a third drink. I used mycard and the servitor slid away on noisy repellers.'Like you,' he said. 'Sort of like you."'Short?" I said. 'Strong arms and legs? A Lusian?" 'Yeah. I guess so.Never been there." 'What else?"' No hair,' said the old man." Just a whattyacallit like myniece used to wear. A pony tail."'A queue,' I said.'Yeah. Whatever." He started to reach for the bills.'Couple more questions. Did they argue?"'Nab. Don't think so. Talked real quiet. Place's pretty empty thattime of day."'What time of day was it ?"'Morning. About ten o'clock."This coincided with the credit flimsy code.'Did you hear any of the conversation?" 'Uh-uh."'Who did most of the talking?"The old man took a drink and furrowed his brow in thought. 'Templar guydid at first. Your man seemed to be answering questions. Seemedsurprised once when I was looking."'Shocked?"'Uh-uh, just surprised. Like the guy in the robe'd said something hedidn't expect."'You said the Templar did most of the talking at first.Who spoke later? My guy?"'Uh-uh, the one with the pony tail. Then they left." 'All three of themleft?"'Nah. Your guy and the pony tail."'The Templar stayed behind?"'Yeah. I guess so. I think. I went to the lay. When I got back Idon't think he was there."'What way did the other two go?"'I don't know, goddammit. I wasn't paying much attention. I was havinga drink, not playing spy!'I nodded. The mech rolled over again but I waved it away. The old manscowled at its back.'So they weren't arguing when they left? No sign of adisagreement or that one was forcing the other to leave?" 'Who?"'My guy and the queue."'Uh-uh. Shit, I don't know." Hc looked down at the bills in his grimyhand and at the whiskey in the mech's display panel, realizing, perhaps,that he wasn't going to get any more of either from me. 'Why do youwant to know all this shit, anyway?"Tm looking for the guy,' I said. I looked around the bar. About twentycustomers sat at tables. Most of them looked like neighborhoodregulars. 'Anyone else here who might've seen them? Or somebody elseyou might remember who was here?"'Uh-uh,' he said dully. I realized then that the old man's eyes wereprecisely the color of the whiskey he'd been drinking.I stood, set a final twenty-mark bill on the table.'Thanks, friend."'Any time, sister."The mech was rolling toward him before l'd reached the door.I walked back toward the library, paused a minute in the busy farcasterplaza, and stood there a minute. Scenario so far: Johnny had met theTemplar or been approached by him, either in the library or outside whenhe arrived in midmorning. They went somewhere private to talk, the bar,and something the Templar said surprised Johnny.A man with a queue - possibly a Lusian - showed up and took over theconversation. Johnny and Queue left together. Sometime after that,Johnny farcast to TC2 and then farcast from there with one other person- possibly Queue or the Templar - to Madhya where someone tried to killhim. Did kill him.Too many gaps. Too many 'someones." Not a hell of a lot to show for aday's work.I was debating whether to 'cast back to Lusus when my comlog chirped onthe restricted comm frequency I'd given to Johnny.His voice was raw. 'M. Lamia. Come quickly, please.I think they've just tried again. To kill me." The coordinates whichfollowed were for the East Bergson Hive.I ran for the farcaster.The door to Johnny's cubby was open a crack. There was no one in thecorridor, no sounds from the apartment.Whatever had happened hadn't brought the authorities yet.I brought out Dad's automatic pistol from my coat pocket, jacked a roundinfo the chamber, and clicked on the laser targeting beam with a singlemotion.I went in low, both arms extended, the red dot sliding across the darkwalls, a cheap print on the far wall, a darker hall leading into thecubby. The foyer was empty.The living room and media pit were empty.Johnny lay on the floor of the bedroom, his head against the bed. Bloodsoaked the sheet. He struggled toprop himself up, fell back. The sliding door behind him was open and adank industrial wind blew in from the open mall beyond.I checked the single closet, short hall, kitchen niche, and came back tostep out on the balcony. The view was spectacular from the perch twohundred or so meters up the curved Hive wall, looking down the ten ortwenty kilometers of the Trench Mall. The roof of the Hive was a darkmass of girders another hundred or so meters above. Thousands oflights, commercial hoios, and neon lights glowed from the mall, joiningin the haze of dis rance to a brilliant, throbbing electric blur.There were hundreds of similar balconies on this wall of the Hive, alldeserted. The nearest was twenty meters away. They were the kind ofthing rental agents like to point to as a plus - God knows that Johnnyprobably paid plenty extra for an outside room - but the balconies weretotally impractical because of the strong wind rushing up toward theventilators, carrying the usual grit and debris as well as the eternalHive scent of oil and ozone.I put my pistol away and went back to check on Johnny.The cut ran from his hairline to his eyebrow, superficial but messy. Hewas sitting up as I returned from the bathroom with a sterile drypad andpressed it against the cut. 'What happened?" I said.'Two men... were waiting in the bedroom when 1 came in. They'dbypassed the alarms on the balcony door."'You deserve a refund on your security tax,' I said.'What happened next?"'We struggled. They seemed to be dragging me toward the door. One ofthem had an injector but I managed to knock it out of his hand."'What made them leave?"'I activated the in-house alarms."'But not Hive security?"'No. I didn't want them involved."'Who hit you?"Johnny smiled sheepishly. 'I did. They released me, I went after them.I managed to trip and fall against the nightstand."'Not a very graceful brawl on either side,' I said. I switched on alamp and checked the carpet until I foundthe injection ampule where it had rolled under the bed.Johnny eyed it as if it were a viper.'What's your guess?" I said. 'More AIDS II?"He shook his head.'I know a place where we can get it analyzed,' I said.'My guess is that it's just a hypnotic trank. They just wanted you tocome along... not to kill you."Johnny moved the drypad and grimaced. The blood was still flowing. 'Whywould anyone want to kidnap a cybrid?"'You tell me. I'm beginning to think that the so-calledmurder was just a botched kidnapping attempt." Johnny shook his headagain.I said, 'Did one of the men wear a queue?"'I don't know. They wore caps and osmosis masks."'Was either one tall enough to be a Templar or strong enough to be aLusian?"'A Templar?" Johnny was surprised. 'No. One was about average Webheight. The one with the ampule could have been Lusian. Strongenough."'So you went after a Lusian thug with your bare hands. Do you have somebioprocessors or augmenta tion implants I don't know about?"'No. I was just mad."I helped him to his feet. 'So Als get angry?"'I do."'Come on,' I said, 'I know an automated med clinic that's discount. Thenyou'll be staying with me for a while."'With you7 Why?"'Because you've graduated from just needing a detective,' I said. 'Nowyou need a bodyguard."My cubby wasn't registered in the Hive zoning schematic as an apartment;I'd taken over a renovated warehouse loft from a friend of mine who'drun afoul of loan sharks. My friend had decided late in life toemigrate toone of the Outback colonies and I'd gotten a good deal on a place just aklick down the corridor from my office.The environment was a littl rough and sometimes the noise from theloading docks could drown out conversation, but it gave me ten times theroom of a normal cubby and I could use my weights and workout equipmentright at home.Johnny honestly seemed intrigued by the place and I had to kick myselffor being pleased. Next thing you knew, l'd be putting on lipstick andbody rouge for this cybrid.'So why do you live on Lusus?" I asked him. 'Most offworiders find thegravity a pain and the scenery monotonous. Plus your researchmaterial's at the library on Renaissance V. Why here?"I found myself looking and listening very carefully as he answered. Hishair was straight on top, parted in the middle, and fell inreddish-brown curls to his collar. He had the habit of resting hischeek on his fist as he spoke.It struck me that his dialect was actually the nondialect of someone whohas learned a new language perfectly but without the lazy shortcuts ofsomeone born to it.And beneath that there was a hint of lilt that brought back theovertones of a cat burglar l'd known who had grown up on Asquith, aquiet, backwater Web world settled by First Expansion immigrants fromwhat had once been the British Isles.'I have lived on many worlds,' he said. 'My purpose is to observe."He shook his head, winced, and gingerly touched the stitches. 'No. I'mnot a poet. He ,,os."Despite the circumstances, there was an energy and vitality to Johnnythat l'd found in too few men. It was hard to describe, but I'd seenrooms full of more important personages rearrange themselves to orbitaround personalities like his. It was not merely his reticence andsensitivity, it was an intensity that he emanated even when merelyobserving.'Why doyou live here?" he asked.'I was born here."'Yes, but you spent your childhood years on Tau CetiCenter. Your father was a senator."I said nothing.'Many people expected you to go into politics,' hesaid. 'Did your father's suicide dissuade you?" 'It wasn't suicide,' Isaid.'No?"'All the news reports and the inquest said it was,' I said tonelessly,'but they were wrong. My father never wouldhave taken his own life." 'So it was murder?" 'Yes."'Despite the fact that there was no motive or hint of asuspect?"'Yes."'I see,' said Johnny. The yellow glow from the loading dock lamps camethrough the dusty windows and made his hair gleam like new copper. 'Doyou like being a detective?"'When I do it well,' I said. 'Are you hungry?"' No. ''Then let's get some sleep. You can have the couch." 'Do you do it welloften?" he said. 'Being a detective?" 'We'll see tomorrow."In the morning Johnny farcast to Renaissance Vector at about the usualtime, waited a moment in the plaza, and then 'cast to the Old Settlers'Museum on Sol Draconi Septera. From there he jumped to the mainterminex on Nordholm and then 'cast to the Templar world of God's Grove.We'd worked out the timing ahead of time and I was waiting for him onRenaissance V, standing back in the shadows of the colonnade.A man with a queue was the third through after Johnny. There was nodoubt he was Lusian - between the Hive pallor, the muscle and body mass,and the arrogant way of walking, he might have been my long-lostbrother.He never looked at Johnny but I could tell that he was surprised whenthe cybrid circled around to the outboundportals. I stayed back and only caught a glimpse of his card butwould've bet anything that it was a tracer.Queue was careful in the Old Settlers' Museum, keeping Johnny in sightbut checking his own back as well. i was dressed in a Zen Gnostic'smeditation jumper, isolation visor and all, and I never looked their wayas 1 circled to the museum outportal and 'cast directly to God's Grove.It made me feel funny, leaving Johnny alone through the museum andNordholm terminex, but both were public places and it was a calculatedrisk.Johnny came through the Worldtree arrival portal right on time andbought a ticket for the tour. His shadow had to scurry to catch up,breaking cover to board the omnibus skimmer before it left. I wasalready settled in the rear seat on the upper deck and Johnny found aplace near the front, just as we had planned.Now I was wearing basic tourist garb and my imager was one of a dozen inaction when Queue hurried to take his place three rows behind Johnny.The tour of the Worldtree is always fun - Dad first took me there when Iwas only three standard - but this time as the skimmer moved abovebranches the size of freeways and circled higher around a trunk thewidth of Olympus Mons, I found myself reacting to the glimpses of hoodedTemplars with something approaching anxiety.Johnny and I had discussed various clever and infinitely subtle ways totrail Queue if he showed up, to follow him to his lair and spend weeksif necessary deducing his game. In the end I opted for something lessthan the subtle approach.The omnibus had dumped us out near the Muir Museum and people weremilling around on the plaza, torn between spending ten marks for aticket to educate themselves or going straight for the gift shop, when Iwalked up to Queue, gripped him by the upper arm, and said inconversational tones, 'Hi. Do you mind telling me what the fuck youwant with my client?"There's an old stereotype that says that Lusians are as subtle as astomach pump and about half as pleasant. IfI'd helped confirm the first part of that, Queue went a long way towardreinforcing the second prejudice.He was fast. Even with my seemingly casual grip paralyzing the musclesof his right arm, the knife in his left hand sliced up and around inless than a second.I let myself fall to my right, the knife slicing air centimeters from mycheek, hitting pavement and rolling as I palmed the neural stunner andcame up on one knee to meet the threat.No threat. Queue was running. Away from me. Away from Johnny. Heshoved tourists aside, dodged behind them, moving toward the museumentrance.I slid the stunner back into its wristband and began running myself.Stunners are great close-range weapons - as easy to aim as a shotgunwithout the dire effects if the spread pattern finds innocent bystanders- but they aren't worth anything beyond eight or ten meters.On full dispersal, I could give half the tourists in the plaza amiserable headache but Queue was already too far away to bring down. Iran after him.Johnny ran toward me. I waved him back. 'My place!' I shouted. 'Usethe locks!'Queue had reached the museum entrance and now he looked back at me; theknife was still in his hand.I charged at him, feeling something like joy at the thought of the nextfew minutes.Queue vaulted a turnstile and shoved tourists aside to get through thedoors. I followed.It was only when I reached the hushed interior of the Grand Hall and sawhim shoving his way up the crowded escalator to the Excursion Mezzaninethat I realized where he was headed.My father had taken me on the Templar Excursion when I was three. Thefarcaster portals were permanently open; it took about three hours towalk all the guided tours on the thirty worlds where the Templarecologists had preserved some bit of nature which they thought wouldplease the Muir. I couldn't remember for sure, but I thought the pathswere loop trails with the portals relatively close together for easytransit by Templar guides and maintenance people.Shit.A uniformed guard near the tour portal saw the confusion as Queue cutthrough and stepped forward to intercept the rude intruder. Even fromfifteen meters away I could see the shock and disbelief on the oldguard's face as he staggered backward, the hilt of Queue's long knifeprotruding from his chest.The old guard, probably a retired local cop, looked down, face white,touched the bone hilL gingerly as if it were a gag, and collapsed facefirst on the mezzanine tiles. Tourists screamed. Someone yelled for amedic. I saw Queue shove a Templar guide aside and throw himselfthrough the glowing portal.This was not going as I'd planned.I vaulted for the portal without slowing.Through and half sliding on the slippery grass of a hillside. Sky lemonyellow above us. Tropical scents. I saw startled faces turned my way.Queue was halfway to the other farcaster, cutting through elaborateflower beds and kicking aside bonsai topiary. I recognized the world ofFuji and careened down the hillside, clambering uphill again through theflower beds, following the trail of destruction Queue had left. 'Stopthat man!" I screamed, realizing how foolish it sounded. No one made amove except for a Nipponese tourist who raised her imager and recorded asequence.Queue looked back, shoved past a gawking tour group, and stepped throughthe farcast portal.I had the stunner in my hand again and waved it at the crowd. 'Back!Back!" They hastily made room.I went through warily, stunner raised. Queue no longer had his knifebut I didn't know what other toys he carried.Brilliant light on water. The violent waves of Mare Infinitus. Thepath was a narrow wooden walkway ten meters above the support floats. Itled out and away, curving above a fairyland coral reef and a sargasso ofyellow island kelp before curving back, but a narrow catwalk cut acrossto the portal at the end of the trail.Queue had climbed the NO ACCESS gate and was halfway across the catwalk.I ran the ten paces to the edge of the platform, selected tightbeam, andheld the stunner on full auto, sweeping the invisible beam hack andforth as if I were aiming a garden hose.Queue seemed to stumble a half step but then made the last ten meters tothe portal and dived through. I cursed and climbed the gate, ignoringshouts from a Templar guide behind me. I caught a glimpse of a signwhich reminded tourists to don therm gear and then I was through theportal, barely sensing the shower-tingle sensation of passing throughthe farcaster screen.A blizzard roared, whipping against the arched con-talnment field whichturned the tourist trail into a tunnel through fierce whiteness. SolDraconi Septem- the northern reaches where Templar lobbying of the AllThing had stopped the colonial heating project in order to save thearctic wraiths. I could feel the 1.7-standard gravity on my shoulderslike the yoke of my workout machine. It was a shame that Queue was aLushan also; if he'd been Web-standard in physique, there would havebeen no contest if I caught him here. Now we would see who was inbetter shape.Queue was fifty meters down the trail and looking back over hisshoulder. The other farcaster was somewhere near but the blizzard madeanything off the trail invisible and inaccessible. I began loping afterhim. In deference to the gravity, this was the shortest of the TemplarExcursion trails, curving back after only two hundred or so meters. Icould hear Queue's panting as I closed on him. I was running easily;there was no way that he was going to beat me to the next farcaster. Isaw no tourists on the trail and so far no one had given chase.I thought that this would not be a bad place to interrogate him.Queue was thirty meters short of the exit portal when he turned, droppedto one knee, and aimed an energy pistol. The first bolt was short,possibly because of the unaccustomed weight of the weapon in SolDraconi's gravity field, but it was close enough to leave a scorchedslash of slagged walkway and melted permafrost to within a meter of me.He adjusted his aim.I went out through the containment field, shouldering my way through theelastic resistance and stumbling into drifts above my waist. The coldair burned my lungs and wind-driven snow caked my face and bare arms inseconds.I could see Queue looking for me from within the lighted pathway, butthe blizzard dimness worked in my favor now as I threw myself throughdrifts in his direction.Queue forced his head, shoulders, and right arm through the field wall,squinting in the barrage of icy particles which coated his cheeks andbrow in an instant.His second shot was high and I felt the heat of the bolt as it passedover. I was within ten meters of him now; I set the stunner on widestdispersal and sprayed it in his direction without lifting my head fromthe snowdrift where I had dropped.Queue let the energy pistol tumble into the snow and fell back throughthe containment field.I screamed in triumph, my shout lost in the wind roar, and staggeredtoward the field wall. My hands and feet were distant things now,beyond the pain of cold. My cheeks and ears burned. I put the thoughtof frostbite out of my mind and threw myself against the field.It was a class-three field, designed to keep out the elements andanything as huge as an arctic wraith, while allowing the occasionalerrant tourist or errand-bent Templar reentry to the path, but in mycold-weakened condition I found myself batting against it for a momentlike a fly against plastic, my feet slipping on snow and ice. Finally Ithrew myself forward, landing heavily and clumsily, dragging my legsthrough.The sudden warmth of the pathway set me to shaking uncontrollably.Shards of sleet fell from me as I forced myself to my knees, then to myfeet.Queue ran the last five yards to the exit portal with his right armdangling as if broken. I knew the nerve-fire agony of a neural stunnerand did not envy him. He looked back once as I began running toward himand then he went through.Maui-Covenant. The air was tropical and smelled of ocean andvegetation. The sky was an Old Earth blue. I saw immediately that thetrail had led to one of the few free motile isles which the Templars hadsaved from Hegemony domestication. It was a large isle, perhaps half akilometer from end to end, and from the access portal's vantage point ona wide deck encircling the main treesail trunk I could see the expansivesail leaves filling with wind and the indigo rudder vines trailing farbehind.The exit portal lay only fifteen meters away down a staircase but I sawat once that Queue had run the other way, along the main trail, toward acluster of huts and concession stands near the edge of the isle.It was only here, halfway along the Templar Excursion trail, that theyallowed human structures to shelter weary hikers while they purchasedrefreshments or souvenirs to benefit the Templar Brotherhood. I beganjogging down the wide staircase to the trail below, still shivering, myclothes soaked with rapidly melting snow.Why was Queue running toward the cluster of people there?I saw the bright carpets laid out for rental and understood.The hawking mats were illegal on most Web worlds but still a traditionon Maui-Covenant because of the Siri legend; less than two meters longand a meter wide, the ancient playthings lay waiting to carry touristsout over the sea and back again to the wandering isle. If Queue reachedone of those... I broke into a full sprint, catching the other Lusian afew meters short of the hawking mat area and tackling him just below theknees.We rolled into the concession stand area and the few tourists thereshouted and scattered.My father taught me one thing which any child ignores at his or her ownperil: a good big guy can always beat a good little guy. In this casewe were about even. Queue twisted free and jumped to his feet, fallinginto an arms-out, fingers-splayed oriental fighting stance. Now we'dsee who the better guy was.Queue got the first blow in, feinting a straight-fingered jab with hisleft hand and coming up and around with a swinging kick instead. Iducked but he connected solidly enough to make my left shoulder andupper arm go numb.Queue danced backward. I followed. He swung a close-fistedright-handed punch. I blocked it. He chopped with his left hand. Iblocked with my right forearm.Queue danced back, whirled, and unleashed a left-footed kick. I ducked,caught his leg as it passed over, and dumped him on the sand.Queue jumped up. I knocked him down with a short left hook. He rolledaway and scrambled to his knees. 1 kicked him behind his left ear,pulling the blow enough to leave him conscious.Too conscious, I realized a second later as he ran four fingers under myguard in an attempted heart jab.Instead, he bruised the layers of muscle under my right breast. Ipunched him full force in the mouth, sending blood spraying as he rolledto the waterline and lay still.Behind us, people ran toward the exit portal, calling to the few othersto get the police.I lifted Johnny's would-be assassin by his queue, dragged him to theedge of the isle, and dipped his face in the water until he came to.Then I rolled him over and lifted him by his torn and stainedshirtfront. We would have only a minute or two until someone arrived.Queue stared up at me with a glazed glare. I shook him once and leanedclose. 'Listen, my friend,' I whispered.'We're going to have a short but sincere conversation.We'll start with who you are and why you're bothering the guy you werefollowing."I felt the surge of current before I saw the blue. I cursed and let goof his shirtfront. The electrical nimbus seemed to surround Queue'sentire body at once. I jumped back but not before my own hair stood onend and surge control alarms on my comlog chirped urgently. Queueopened his mouth to scream and I could see the blue within like a poorlydone holo special effect.His shirtfront sizzled, blackened, and burst into flame.Beneath it his chest grew blue spots like an ancient film burningthrough. The spots widened, joined, widened again. I looked into hischest cavity and saw organs melting in blue flame. He screamed again,audibly this time, and I watched as teeth and eyes collapsed into bluefire.I took another step back.Queue was burning now, the orange-red flames superseding the blue glow.His flesh exploded outward with flame as if his bones had ignited.Within a minute he was a smoking caricature of charred flesh, the bodyreduced to the ancient dwarf-boxer posture of burning victimseverywhere. I turned away and put a hand over my mouth, searching thefaces of the few watchers to see if any of them could have done this.Wide, frightened eyes stared back. Far above, gray security uniformsburst from the farcaster.Damn. I looked around. The treesails surged and bil-lowed overhead.Radiant gossamers, beautiful even in daylight, flitted among tropicalvegetation of a hundred hues. Sunlight danced on blue ocean. The wayto both portals was blocked. The security guard leading the group haddrawn a weapon.I was to the first hawking mat in three strides, trying to remember frommy own ride two decades earlier how the flight threads were activated. Itapped designs in desperation.The hawking mat went rigid and lifted ten centimeters off the beach. Icould hear the shouts now as security guards reached the edge of thecrowd. A woman in gaudy Renaissance Minor garb pointed my way. Ijumped off the hawking mat, gathered up the other seven mats, and jumpedaboard my own. Barely able to find the flight designs under the tumbleof rugs, I slapped the forward controls until the mat lurched intoflight, almost tumbling me off as it rose.Fifty meters out, thirty meters high, I dumped the other mats into thesea and swiveled to see what was happening on the beach. Several grayuniforms were huddled around the burned remains. Another pointed asilver wand in my direction.Delicate needles of pain tingled along my arm, shoulders, and neck. Myeyelids drooped and I almost slid off the mat to my right. I grippedthe far side with my left hand, slumped forward, and tapped at theascent design with fingers made of wood. Climbing again, I fumbled atmy right sleeve for my own stunner. The wristband was empty.A minute later I sat up and shook off most of the effects of the stun,although my fingers still burned and I had a fierce headache. Themotile isle was far behind, shrinking more each second. A century agothe island would have been driven by the bands of dolphins brought hereoriginally during the Hegira, but the Hegemony pacification programduring the Siri Rebellion had killed off most of the aquatic mammals andnow the islands wandered listlessly, carrying their cargo of Webtourists and resort ownersI checked the horizons for another island, a hint of one of the raremainlands. Nothing. Or, rather, blue sky, endless. ocean, and softbrushstrokes of clouds far to the west. Or was it to the east?I pulled my comiog off my belt lock and keyed in general datasphereaccess, then stopped. If the authorities had chased me this far, thenext step would be to pinpoint my location and send out a skimmer orsecurity EMV. I wasn't sure if they could trace my comlog when I loggedin but I saw no reason to help them. I thumbed the comm-link on standbyand looked around again.Good move, Brawne. Poking along at two hundred meters on athree-century-old hawking mat with who knows how many... or how few!...hours of charge in its flight threads, possibly a thousand klicks ormore from land of any sort. And lost. Great. I crossed my arms andsat back to think.'M. Lamia?" Johnny's soft voice almost made me jump off the mat.'Johnny?" I stared at the cornlog. It was still on standby. Thegeneral comm frequency indicator was dark. 'Johnny, is that you?"'Of course. I thought you'd never turn your comlog on."'How did you trace me? What band are you calling o!i?"'Never mind that. Where are you headed?"I laughed and told him that I didn't have the slightest idea. 'Can youhelp?"'Wait." There was the briefest second of pause. 'Allright, I have you on one of the weather-mapping sats. A terriblyprimitive thing. Good thing your hawking mat has a passivetransponder."I stared at the rug that was the only thing between me and a long, loudfall to the sea. 'It does? Can the others track me?"'They could,' said Johnny, 'but I'm jamming this par ticular signal.Now, where do you want to go?" 'Home."'I'm not sure if that's wise after the death of... ah  . . oursuspect."I squinted, suddenly suspicious. 'How do you know about that? I didn'tsay anything."'Be serious, M. Lamia. The security bands are full of it on sixworlds. They have a reasonable description of you. ''Shit."'Precisely. Now where would you like to go?" 'Where are you?" I asked.'My place?"'No. I left there when the security bands mentioned you. I'm... neara farcaster."'That's where I need to be." I looked around again.Ocean sky, a hint of clouds. At least no fleets of EMVs.'All right,' said Johnny's disembodied voice. 'There's a powered-downFORCE multi-portal less than ten klicks from your present location."I shielded my eyes and rotated three hundred and sixty degrees. 'Thehell there is,' I said. 'I don't know how far away the horizon is onthis world, but it's at least forty klicks and I can't see anything."'Submersible base,' said Johnny. 'Hang on. l'm going to take control."The hawking mat lurched again, dipped once, and then fell steadily. Iheld on with both hands and resisted the urge to scream.'Submersible,' I called against the wind rush, 'how far?"'Do you mean how deep?"'Yeah!''Eight fathoms."I converted the archaic units to meters. This time I didscream. 'That's almost fourteen meters underwater!' 'Where else do youexpect a submersible to be?"'What the hell do you expect me to do, hold my breath?" The ocean rushedtoward me.'Not necessary,' said my comlog. 'The hawking mat has a primitive crashfield. It should easily hold for a mere eight fathoms. Please hangon."I hung on.Johnny was waiting for me when I arrived. The submersible had been darkand dank with the sweat of abandonment; the farcaster had been of amilitary variety l'd never seen before. It was a relief to step intosunlight and a city street with Johnny waiting.I told him what had happened to Queue. We walked empty streets past oldbuildings. The sky was pale blue fading toward evening. No one was insight. 'Hey,' I said, stopping, 'where are we?" It was an incrediblyEarthlike world but the sky, the gravity, the texture of the place waslike nothing I'd visited.Johnny smiled. 'I'11 let you guess. Let's walk some more."There were ruins to our left as we walked down a wide street. I stoppedand stared. 'That's the Colosseum,' I said. 'The Roman Colosseum onOld Earth." I looked around at the aging buildings, the cobblestonestreets, and the trees swaying slightly in a soft breeze. 'This is areconstruction of the Old Earth city of Rome,' I said, trying to keepthe astonishment out of my voice. 'New Earth?" I knew at once that itwasn't. I'd been to New Earth numerous times and the sky tones, smells,and gravity had not been like this.Johnny shook his head. 'This is nowhere in the Web." I stopped walking.'That's impossible." By definition, any world which could be reached byfarcaster was in the Web.'Nonetheless, it is not in the Web." 'Where is it then?" 'Old Earth."We walked on. Johnny pointed out another ruin. 'The Forum." Descendinga long staircase, he said, 'Ahead is the Piazza di Spagna where we'llspend the night."'Old Earth,' I said, my first comment in twenty minutes.'Time travel?"'That is not possible, M. Lamia."'A theme park then?"Johnny laughed. It was a pleasant laugh, unself-conscious and easy.'Perhaps. I don't really know its purpose or function. It is... ananalog."'An analog." I squinted at the red, setting sun just visible down anarrow street. 'It looks like the holos I've seen of Old Earth. Itfeels right, even though l've never been there."'It is very accurate."'Where is it? I mean, what star?"'I don't know the number,' said Johnny. 'It's in the Hercules Cluster."I managed not to repeat what he said but I stopped and sat down on oneof the steps. With the Hawking drive humankind had explored, colonized,and linked with farcaster worlds across many thousands of light-years.But no one had tried to reach the exploding Core suns.We had barely crawled out of the cradle of one spiral arm. The HerculesCluster.'Why has the TechnoCore built a replica of Rome in the HerculesCluster?" 1 asked.Johnny sat next to me. We both looked up as a whirling mass of pigeonsexploded into flight and wheeled above the rooftops. 'I don't know, M.Lamia.There is much that I have not learned ... at least partially because Ihave not been interested until now. ''Brawne,' I said.'Excuse me?" 'Call me Brawne."Johnny smiled and inclined his head. 'Thank you, Brawne. One thing,though. I do not believe that it is a replica of the city of Romealone. It is all of Old Earth."l set both hands on the sun-warmed stone of the step I was sitting on.'All of Old Earth? All of its... continents, cities?"'l believe so. I haven't been out of ltaly and Englandexcept for a sea voyage between the two, but I believe the analog iscomplete."'Why, for God's sake?"Johnny nodded slowly. 'That may indeed be the case.Why don't we go inside and eat and talk more about this? It may relateto who tried to kill me and why."'Inside' was an apartment in a large house at the foot of the marblestairs. Windows looked out on what Johnny called the 'piazza' and Icould see up the staircase to a large, yellow-brown church above, anddown to the square where a boat-shaped fountain tossed water into theevening stillness. Johnny said that the fountain had been designed byBernini but the name meant nothing to me.The rooms were small but high-ceilinged, with rough but elaboratelycarved furniture from an era I did not recognize. There was no sign ofelectricity or modern appliances. The house did not respond when Ispoke to it at the door and again in the apartment upstairs. As duskfell over the square and city outside the tall windows, the only lightswere a few streetlamps of gas or some more primitive combustible.'This is out of Old Earth's past,' I said, touching the thick pillows. Iraised my head, suddenly understanding.'Keats died in Italy. Early... nineteenth or twentieth century. Thisis... then."'Yes. Early nineteenth century: 1821, to be precise." 'The whole worldis a museum?"'Oh no. Different areas are different eras, of course. It depends uponthe analog being pursued."'I don't understand." We had moved into a room cluttered with thickfurniture and I sat on an oddly carved couch by a window. A film ofgold evening light still touched the spire of the tawny church up thesteps.Pigeons wheeled white against blue sky. 'Are there millions ofpeople... cybrids... living on this fake Old Earth?"'I do not believe so,' said Johnny. 'Only the number necessary for theparticular analog project." He saw that ! still did not understand andtook a breath before continuing. 'When I... awoke here, there werecybrid analogs of Joseph Severn, Dr Clark, the landlady Anna Angeletti,young Lieutenant Elton, and a few others.Italian shopkeepers, the owner of the trattoria across the square whoused to bring us our food, passersby, thatsort of thing. No more than a score at the most." 'What happened tothem?"'They were probably... recycled. Like the man with the queue."'Queue..." I suddenly stared across the darkening room at Johnny. 'Hewas a cybrid?"'Without doubt. The self-destruction you described is precisely the wayI would rid myself of this cybrid if I had tO."My mind was racing. I realized how stupid I had been, how little I hadlearned about anything. 'Then it wasanother AI who tried to kill you." 'It seems that way." 'Why?"Johnny made a gesture with his hands. 'Possibly to erase some quantumof knowledge that died with my cybrid. Something I had learned onlyrecently and the other AI ... or Als knew would be destroyed in mysystems crash."I stood, paced back and forth, and stopped at the window. The darknesswas settling in earnest now. There were lamps in the room but Johnnymade no move to light them and I preferred the dimness. It made theunreality of what I was hearing even that much more unreal. I lookedinto the bedroom. The western windows admitted the last of the light;bedclothes glowed whitely.'You died here,' I said.'He did,' said Johnny. 'I am not he." 'But you have his memories."'Half-forgotten dreams. There are gaps." 'But you know what he felt."'1 remember what the designers thought that he felt." 'Tell me."'What?" Johnny's skin was very pale in the gloom. His short curlslooked black.'What it was like to die. What it was like to be reborn."Johnny told me, his voice very soft, almost melodic, lapsing sometimesinto an English too archaic to be understood but far more beautiful tothe ear than the hybrid tongue we speak today.He told me what it was like to be a poet obsessed with perfection, farharsher toward his own efforts than even the most vicious critic. Andthe critics were vicious. His work was dismissed, ridiculed, describedas derivative and silly. Too poor to marry the woman he loved, loaningmoney to his brother in America and thus losing the last chance offinancial security... and then the brief glory of growing into the fullmaturation of his poetic powers just as he fell prey to the'consumption' which had claimed his mother and his brother Tom. Thensent off to exile in Italy, reputedly 'for his health' while knowing allthe while it meant a lonely, painful death at the age of twenty-six. Hetalked of the agony of seeing Fanny's handwriting on the letters hefound too painful to open; he talked of the loyalty of the young artistJoseph Severn, who had been chosen as a traveling companion for Keats by'friends' who had abandoned the poet at the end, of how Severn hadnursed the dying man and stayed with him during the final days. He toldof the hemorrhages in the night, of Dr Clark bleeding him andprescribing 'exercise and good air,' and of the ultimate religious andpersonal despair which had led Keats to demand his own epitaph be carvedin stone as: 'Here lies One Whose Name was writ in Water."Only the dimmest light from below outlined the tall windows. Johnny'svoice seemed to fioat in the night-scented air. He spoke of awakeningafter his death in the bed where he died, still attended by the loyalSevern and Dr Clark, of remembering that he was the poet John Keats theway one remembers an identity from a fast-fading dream while all thewhile knowing that he was something else.He told of the illusion continued, the trip back to England, the reunionwith the Fanny-who-was-not-Fanny and the near mental breakdown this hadengendered.He told of his inability to write further poetry, of his increasingestrangement from the cybrid impostors,of his retreat into something resembling catatonia combined with'hallucinations' of his true AI existence in the nearly incomprehensible(to a nineteenth-century poet) TechnoCore, and of the ultimate crumblingof the illusion and the abandonment of the 'Keats Project."'In truth,' he said, 'the entire, evil charade made me think of nothingso much as a passage in a letter I wrote  . . he wrote... to hisbrother George some time before his illness. Keats said:'May there not be superior beings amused with any graceful, thoughinstinctive attitude my mind may fall into, as I am entertained with thealertness of a Stoat or the anxiety of a Deer? Though a quarrel in thestreets is a thing to be hated, the energies dis played in it are fine.By a superior being our reasonings may take the same tone - thougherroneous they may be fine - This is the very thing in which consistspoetry."'You think the . . . Keats Project . . . was evil?" I asked.'Anything which deceives is evil, I believe."'Perhaps you are more John Keats than you are willing to admit."'No. The absence of poetic instinct showed otherwise even in the midstof the most elaborate illusion."I looked at the dark outlines of shapes in the dark house. 'Do the AIsknow that we're here?"'Probably. Almost surely. There is no place that I can go that theTechnoCore cannot trace and follow. But it was the Web authorities andbrigands from whom we fled, no?"'But you know now that it was someone . . . some intelligence in theTechnoCore who assaulted you."'Yes, but only in the Web. Such violence in the Core would not betolerated."There came a noise from the street. A pigeon, I hoped.Wind blowing trash across cobblestones perhaps. 1 said, 'How will theTechnoCore respond to my being here?"'1 have no idea."'Surely it must be a secret."'It is ... something they consider irrelevant to humanity."I shook my head, a futile gesture in the darkness. 'The re-creation ofOld Earth... the resurrection of... how many? ... humanpersonalities as cybrids on this re-created world... AIs killing Als...irrelevant!" I laughed but managed to keep the laughter under control.'Jesus wept, Johnny."'Almost certainly."I moved to the window, not caring what sort of target l would affordanyone in t he dark street below, and fumbled out a cigarette. Theywere damp from the afteruoon's chase through the snowdrifts but onelighted when I struck it. 'Johnny, earlier when you said that the OldEarth analog was complete, I said,"Why, for God's sake?" and you saidsomething like "That may be the case." Was thatjust a wiseass comment or did you mean something?" 'I mean that it mightindeed be for God's sake." 'Explain."Johnny sighed in the darkness. 'I don't understand the exact purpose ofthe Keats Project or the other Old Earth analogs, but I suspect that itis part of a TechnoCore project going back at least seven standardcenturies to realize the Ultimate Intelligence."'The Ultimate Intelligence,' I said, exhaling smoke.'Uh-huh. So theTechnoCore is trying to... what?... tobuild God." 'Yes,' 'Why?"'There is no simple answer, Brawne. Any more than there is a simpleanswer to the question of why humankind has sought God in a millionguises for ten thousand generations.But with the Core, the interest lies more in the quest for moreefficiency, more reliable ways to handle...variables."'But the TechnoCore can draw on itself and the mega-datasphere of twohundred worlds."'And there still will be blanks in the . . . predictive powers."I threw my cigarette out the window, watching the ember fall into thenight. The breeze was suddenly cold; 1 hugged my arms. 'How does allthis... Old Earth, the resurrection projects, the cybrids... how doesit lead to creating the Ultimate Intelligence?"'I don't know, Brawne. Eight standard centuries ago, at the beginningof the First Information Age, a man named Norbert Wiener wrote: "Can Godplay a significant game with his own creature? Can any creator, even alimited one, play a significant game with his own creature?"Humanity dealt with this inconclusively with their early Als. The Corewrestles with it in the resurrection projects. Perhaps the UI programhas been completed and all of this remains a function of the ultimateCreature/Creator, a personality whose motives are as far beyond theCore's understanding as the Core's are beyond humanity's."I started to move in the dark room, bumped a low table with my knee, andremained standing. 'None of which tells us who is trying to kill you,'I said.'No." Johnny rose and moved to the far wall. A match flared and helighted a candle. Our shadows wavered on the walls and ceiling.Johnny came closer and softly gripped my upper arms. The soft lightpainted his curls and eyelashes copper and touched his high cheekbonesand firm chin.'Why are you so tough?" he asked.I stared at him. His face was only inches from mine.We were the same height. 'Let go,' I said.Instead, he leaned forward and kissed me. His lips were soft and warmand the kiss seemed to last for hours.He's a machine, I thought. Human, but a machine behind that. 1 closedmy eyes. His soft hand touched my cheek, my neck, the back of my head.'Listen..." I whispered when we broke apart for an instant.Johnny did not let me finish. He lifted me in his arms and carried meinto the other room. The tall bed. The soft mattress and deepcomforter. The candlelight from the other room flickered and danced aswe undressed each other in a sudden urgency.We made love three times that night, each time responding to slow, sweetimperatives of touch and warmth and closeness and the escalatingintensity of sensation.I remember looking down at him the second time; his eyes were closed,hair fell loosely across his forehead, the candlelight showing the flushacross his pale chest, his surprisingly strong arms and hands rising tohold me in place. He had opened his eyes that second to look back at meand I saw only the emotion and passion of that moment reflected there.Sometime before dawn we slept; just as I turned away and drifted off, Ifelt the cool touch of his hand on my hip in a movement protective andcasual without being possessive.They hit us just after first light. There were five of them, not Lusianbut heavily muscled, all men, and they worked well together as a team.The first I heard of them was when the door to the apartment was kickedopen. I rolled out of bed, jumped to the side of the bedroom door, andwatched them come through. Johnny sat up and shouted something as thefirst man leveled a stunner. Johnny had pulled on cotton shorts beforegoing to sleep; I was nude. There are real disadvantages to fighting inthe nude when one's opponents are dressed, but the greatest problem ispsychological.If you can get over the sense of heightened vulnerability, the rest iseasy to compensate for.The first man saw me, decided to stun Johnny anyway, and paid for themistake. I kicked the weapon out of his hand and clubbed him down witha blow behind the left ear. Two more men pushed into the room. Thistime both of them were smart enough to deal with me first. Two othersleaped for Johnny.I blocked a stiff-fingered jab, parried a kick that would have done realdamage, and backed away. There was a tall dresser to my left and thetop drawer came out smooth and heavy. The big man in front of meshielded his face with both arms so that the thick wood splintered, butthe instinctive reaction gave me a second's opening and I took it,putting my entire body into the kick.Number two man grunted and fell back against his partner.Johnny was struggling but one of the intruders had him around the throatin a choke hold while the other pinned his legs. I came off the floorin a crouch, accepted the blow from my number two, and leaped across thebed. The guy holding Johnny's legs went through the glass and wood ofthe window without a word.Someone landed on my back and I completed the roll across the bed andfloor, bringing him up against the wall. He was good. He took the blowon his shoulder and went for a nerve pinch beneath my ear. He had asecond of trouble because of the extra layers of muscle there and I gotan elbow deep into his stomach and rolled away.The man choking Johnny dropped him and delivered a text-book-perfectkick to my ribs. I took half the impact, feeling at least one rib go,and spun inside, attempting no elegance as I used my left hand to crushhis left testicle.The man screamed and was out of it.I'd never forgotten the stunner on the floor and neither had the last ofthe opposition. He scurried around to the far side of the bed, out ofreach, and dropped to all fours to grab the weapon. Definitely feelingthe pain from the broken rib now, I lifted the massive bed with Johnnyin it and dropped it on the guy's head and shoulders.I went under the bed from my side, retrieved the stunner, and backedinto an empty corner.One guy had gone out the window. We were on the second floor. Thefirst man to enter was still lying in the doorway. The guy I'd kickedhad managed to get to one knee and both elbows. From the blood on hismouth and chin, I guessed that a rib had punctured a lung. He wasbreathing very raggedly. The bed had crushed the skull of the other manon the floor. The guy who'd been choking Johnny was curled up near thewindow, holding his crotch and vomiting. I stunned him into silence andwent over to the one I'd kicked and lifted him by the hair.'Who sent you?"'Fuck you." He sprayed some bloody spittle in my face.'Maybe later,' I said 'Again, who sent you?" I placed three fingersagainst his side where the ribcage seemed concave and pressed.The man screamed and went very white. When he coughed the blood was toored against pale skin.'Who sent you?" I set four fingers against his ribs.'The bishop!" He tried to levitate away from my fingers.'What bishop?"'Shrike Temple... Lusus... don't, please... oh, shit..."'What were you going to do with him... us?"'Nothing ... Oh, God damn . . . don't! I need a medic, please!''Sure. Answer."'Stun him, bring him . . . back to the Temple . . .Lusus. Please. I can't breathe."'And me?"'Kill you if you resisted."'Okay,' I said, lifting him a little higher by his hair, 'we're doingfine here. What did they want him for?"'I don't know." He screamed very loudly. I kept one eye on the doorwayto the apartment. The stunner .was still in my palm under a fistful ofhair. 'I... don't...know..." he gasped. He was hemorrhaging in earnestnow. The blood dripped on my arm and left breast.'How'd you get here?" 'EMV... roof." 'Where'd you 'cast in?"'Don't know... I swear... some city in the water.Cat's set to return there... please!'I ripped at his clothes. No comlog. No other weapons.There was a tattoo of a blue trident just above his heart.'Goonda?" I said.'Yeah... Parvati Brotherhood."Outside the Web. Probably very hard to trace. 'All of you?"'Yeah... please... get me some help... oh, shit .. please..." Hesagged, almost unconscious.I dropped him, stepped back, and sprayed the stun beam over him.Johnny was sitting up, rubbing his throat, and staring at me with astrange gaze.'Get dressed,' I said. 'We're leaving."The EMV was an old, transparent Vikken Scenic with no palmlocks on theignition plate or diskey. We caught up to the terminator before we hadcrossed France and looked down on darkness that Johnny said was theAtlantic Ocean. Except for lights of the occasional floating city ordrilling platform, the only illumination came from the stars and thebroad, swimming-pool glows of the undersea colonies.'Why are we taking their vehicle?" asked Johnny.'I want to see where they farcast from." :He said the Lusus ShrikeTemple." 'Yeah. Now we'll see."Johnny's face was barely visible as he looked down at the dark seatwenty klicks below. 'Do you think those men will die?"'One was already dead,' I said. 'The guy with the punctured lung willneed help. Two of them'll be okay. I don't know about the one who wentout the window. Do you care?"'Yes. The violence was... barbaric."' "Though a quarrel in the street is a thing to be hated, the energiesdisplayed in it are fine," ' I quoted. 'Theyweren't cybrids, were they?"'I think not."'So there are at least two groups out to get you the Als and the bishopof the Shrike Temple. And we still don't know why."'I do have an idea now."I swiveled in the foam reelinet. The constellations above us - familiarneither from holos of Old Earth's skies nor from any Web world I knew -cast just enough light to allow me to see Johnny's eyes. 'Tell me,' Isaid.'Your mention of Hyperion gave me a clue,' he said.'The fact that I had no knowledge of it. Its absence said that it wasimportant."'The strange case of the dog barking in the night,' l said.'What?"'Nothing. Go on."Johnny leaned closer 'The only reason that I would not be aware of itis that some elements of the Techno-Core have blocked my knowledge ofit."'Your cybrid..." It was strange to talk to Johnny that way now. 'Youspend most of your time in the Web,don't you?"'Yes."'Wouldn't you run across mention of Hyperion somewhere?It's in the news every once in a while, especially when the ShrikeCult's topical."'Perhaps I did hear. Perhaps that is why I was murdered."I lay back and looked at the stars. 'Let's go ask the bishop,' I said.Johnny said that the lights ahead were an analog of New York City in themid-twenty-first century. He didn't know what resurrection project thecity had been rebuilt for. I took the EMV off auto and dropped lower.Tall buildings from the phallic-symbol era of urban architecture rosefrom the swamps and lagoons of the North American littoral. Several hadlights burning.Johnny pointed to one decrepit but oddly elegant structure and said,'The Empire State Building."'Okay,' I said. 'Whatever it is, that's where the EMVwants to land."'Is it safe?"I grinned at him. 'Nothing in life's safe." I let the car have its headand we dropped to a small, open platform below the building's spire. Wegot out and stood on the cracked balcony. It was quite dark except forthe few building lights far below and the stars. A few paces away, avague blue glow outlined a farcaster portal where elevator doors mayonce have been.'I'11 go first,' I said but Johnny had already stepped through. Ipalmed the borrowed stunner and followed him.I'd never been in the Shrike Temple on Lusus before but there was nodoubt that we were there now. Johnny stood a few paces ahead of me butother than him there was no one around The place was cool and dark andcavernous if caverns could really be that large. A frighteningpolychrome sculpture which hung from invisible cables rotated to unfeltbreezes. Johnny and I both turned as the farcaster portal winked out ofexistence.'Well, we did their work for them, didn't we?" I whispered to Johnny.Even the whisper seemed to echo in the red-lit hall. I hadn't plannedon Johnny 'casting to the Temple with me.The light seemed to come up then, not really illuminating the great hallbut widening its scope so that we could see the semicircle of men there.I remembered that some were called exorcists and others lectors andthere was some other category I forgot. Whoever they were, it wasalarming to see them standing there, at least two dozen of them, theirrobes variations on red and black and their high foreheads glowing fromthe red light above. I had no trouble recognizing the bishop. He wasfrom my world, although shorter and fatter than most of us, and his robewas very red.I did not try to hide the stunner. It was possible that if they alltried to rush us I could bring them all down.Possible but not probable. I could not see any weapons but their robescould have hidden entire arsenals.Johnny walked toward the bishop and I followed. Ten paces from the manwe stopped. The bishop was the only one not standing. His chair wasmade of wood and looked as if it could be folded so that the intricatearms, supports, back, and legs could be carried in a compact form. Onecouldn't say the same of the mass of muscle and fat evident under thebishop's robes.Johnny took another step forward. 'Why did you try to kidnap mycybrid?" He spoke to the Shrike Cult holy man as if the rest of us werenot there.The bishop chuckled and shook his head. 'My dear  . . entity... itis true that we wished your presence in our place of worship, but youhave no evidence that we were involved in any attempt to kidnap you."'I'm not interested in evidence,' said Johnny. 'I'm curious as to whyyou want me here." I heard a rustling behind us and I swiveled quickly,thestunner charged and pointed, but the broad circle of Shrike priestsremained motionless. Most were out of the stunner's range. I wishedthat I had brought my father's projectile weapon with me.The bishop's voice was deep and textured and seemed to fill the hugespace. 'Surely you know that the Church of the Final Atonement has adeep and abiding interest inthe world of Hyperion."'Yes."'And surely you are aware that during the past several centuries thepersona of the Old Earth poet Keats has been woven into the culturalmythos of the Hyperion colony?"'Yes. So?"The bishop rubbed his cheek with a large red ring on one finger. 'Sowhen you offered to go on the Shrike Pilgrimage we agreed. We weredistressed when you reneged on this offer."Johnny's look of amazement .was most human. 'I offered? When?"'Eight local days ago,' said the bishop. 'In this room.You approached us with the idea."'Did I say why I wanted to go on the . . . Shrike Pilgrimage?"'You said that it was... I believe the phrase you used was..."important for your education." We can show you the recording if youwish. All such conversations in the Temple are recorded. Or you mayhave a duplicate ofthe recording to view at your own convenience."'Yes,' said Johnny.The bishop nodded and an acolyte or whatever the hell he was disappearedinto the gloom for a moment and returned with a standard video chip inhis hand. The bishop nodded again and the blackrobed man came forwardand handed the chip to Johnny. I kept the stunner ready until the guyhad returned to the semicircle of watchers.'Why did you send the goondas after us?" I asked. It was the first timeI'd spoken in front of the bishop and my voice sounded too loud and tooraw.The Shrike holy man made a gesture with one pudgyhand. 'M. Keats had expressed an interest in joining our holiestpilgrimage. Since it is our belief that the Final Atonement is drawingcloser each day, this is of no little importance to us. Consequently,our agents reported that M. Keats may have been the victim of one ormore assaults and that a certain private investigator... you, M.Lamia... was responsible for destroying the cybridbodyguard provided M. Keats by the TechnoCore." 'Bodyguard!" It was myturn to sound amazed.'Of course,' said the bishop. He turned toward Johnny. 'The gentlemanwith the queue who was recently murdered on the Temple Excursion, wasthis not the same man whom you introduced as your bodyguard a weekearlier? He is visible in the recording."Johnny said nothing. He seemed to be straining to remember something.'At any rate,' continued the bishop, 'we must have your answer about thepilgrimage before the week is out.The Sequoia Sernpervirens departs from the Web in nine local days."'But that'S a Templar treeship,' said Johnny. 'They don't make the longleap to Hyperion."The bishop smiled. 'In this case it does. We have reason to believethat this may be the last Church-sponsored pilgrimage and we havechartered the Templar craft to allow as many of the faithful as possibleto make the trip." The bishop gestured and red-and-black-robed men fadedback into darkness. Two exorcists came forward to fold his stool as thebishop stood. 'Please give us your answer as soon as possible." He wasgone. The remaining exorcist stayed to show us out.There were no more farcasters. We exited by the main door of the Templeand stood on the top step of the long staircase, looking down on theConcourse Mall of Hive Center and breathing in the cool, oil-scentedair.My father's automatic was in the drawer where I'd left it.I made sure there was a full load of fl6chettes, palmed the magazineback in, and carried the weapon into the kitchen where breakfast wascooking. Johnny sat at the long table, staring down through graywindows at theloading dock. I carried the omelets over and set one in front of him.He looked up as I poured the coffee.'Do you believe him?" I asked. 'That it was your idea7' 'You saw thevideo recording." 'Recordings can be faked." 'Yes. But this onewasn't."'Then why did you volunteer to go on this pilgrimage?And why did your bodyguard try to kill you after you talked to theShrike Church and the Templar captain?"Johnny tried the omelet, nodded, and took another forkful. 'The...bodyguard... is a complete unknown to me. He must have been assignedto me during the week lost to memory. His real purpose obviously was tomake sure that I did not discover something... or, if I did stumbleupon it, to eliminate me."'Something in the Web or in datumplane?"'In the Web, I presume."'We need to know who he... it... worked for and why they assigned himto you."'I do know,' said Johnny. 'I just asked. The Core responds that Irequested a bodyguard. The cybrid was controlled by an AI nexus whichcorresponds to a security force."'Ask why he tried to kill you."'I did. They emphatically deny that such a thing is possible."'Then why was this so-called bodyguard slinking around after you a weekafter the murder?"'They respond that while I did not request security again after my...discontinuity... the Core authorities felt that it would be prudent toprovide protection."I laughed. 'Some protection. Why the hell did he run on the Templarworld when I caught up to him? They aren'teven trying to give you a plausible story, Johnny."'No."'Nor did the bishop explain how the Shrike Church had farcaster accessto Old Earth... or whatever you call that stage-set world."'And we did not ask."'/didn't ask because I wanted to get out of that damn Temple in onepiece."Johnny didn't seem to hear. He was sipping his coffee,his gaze focused somewhere else.'What?" I said.He turned to look at me, tapping his thumbnail on hislower lip. 'There is a paradox here, Brawne."'What7''If it was truly my aim to go to Hyperion... for my cybrid to travelthere... I could not have remained in the TechnoCore. I would have hadto invest all consciousness in the cybrid itself."'Why?" But even as I asked I saw the reason.'Think. Datumplane itself is an abstract. A commingling of computerand AI-generated dataspheres and the quasi-perceptual Gibsonian matrixdesigned originally for human operators, now accepted as common groundfor man, machine, and AI."'But AI hardware exists somewhere in real space,' I said. 'Somewhere inthe TechnoCore."'Yes, but that is irrelevant to the function of AI consciousness,' saidJohnny. 'I can "be" anywhere the overlapping dataspheres allow me totravel . . . all of the Web worlds, of course, datumplane, and any ofthe TechnoCore constructs such as Old Earth... but it's only withinthat milieu that I can claim "consciousness" or operate sensors orremotes such as this cybrid."I set my coffee cup down and stared at the thing I had loved as a manduring the night just past. 'Yes?"'The colony worlds have limited dataspheres,' said Johnny. 'While thereis some contact with the Techno-Core via fatline transmissions, it is anexchange of data only... rather like the First Information Age computerinterfaces ... rather than a flow of consciousness.Hyperion's datasphere is primitive to the point of nonexistence.And from what I can access, the Core has no contact whatsoever with thatworld."'Would that be normaIT I asked. 'I mean with a colony world that faraway?"'No. The Core has contact with every colony world, with suchinterstellar barbarians as the Ousters, and with other sources theHegemony could not imagine."I sat stunned. 'With the Ousters?" Since the war onBressia a few years earlier, the Ousters had been the Web's primebogeymen. The idea of the Core . . . the same congregation of Alswhich advises the Senate and the All Thing and which allows our entireeconomy, farcaster system, and technological civilization to run  . .the idea of the Core being in touch with the Ousters was frightening.And what the hell did Johnny mean by 'other sources'? I didn't reallywant to know right then.'But you said it is possible for your cybrid to travel there?" I said.'What did you mean by "investing all consciousness" in your cybrid? Canan AI become...human? Can you exist only in your cybrid?"'It has been done,' Johnny said softly. 'Once. A personalityreconstruction not too different from my own.A twentieth-century poet named Ezra Pound. He abandoned his AI personaand fled from the Web in hiscybrid. But the Pound reconstruction was insane." 'Or sane,' I said.'Yes."'So all of the data and personality of an AI can survive in a cybrid'sorganic brain."'Of course not, Brawne. Not one percent of one percent of my totalconsciousness would survive the transition. Organic brains can'tprocess even the most primitive information the way we can. Theresultant personality would not be the AI persona . . . neither wouldit be a truly human consciousness or cybrid..." Johnny stopped inmid-sentence and turned quickly to look out the window.After a long minute I said, 'What is it?" I reached out a hand but didnot touch him.He spoke without turning. 'Perhaps I was wrong to say that theconsciousness would not be human,' he whispered. 'It is possible thatthe resulting persona could be human touched with a certain divinemadness and meta-human perspective. It could be . . . if purged ofall memory of our age, of all consciousness of the Core  . . it couldbe the person the cybrid was programmed to be..."'John Keats,' I said.Johnny turned away from the window and closed his eyes. His voice washoarse with emotion. It was the first time I had heard him recitepoetry:'Fanatics have their dreams, wherewith they weave A paradise for a sect,the savage tooFrom forth the loftiest fashion of his sleep Guesses at Heaven; pitythese have notTraced upon vellum or wild Indian leafThe shadows of melodious utterance.But bare of laurel they live, dream, and die;For Poesy alone can tell her dreams,With the fine spell of words alone can save Imagination from the sablecharmAnd dumb enchantment. Who alive can say, "Thou art no Poet - mayst nottell thy dreams"?Since every man whose soul is not a clodHath visions, and would speak, if he had loved, And been well nurturedin his mother tongue.Whether the dream now purposed to rehearseBe Poet's or Fanatic's will be knownWhen this warm scribe my hand is in the grave."'I don't get it,' I said. 'What does it mean?"'It means,' said Johnny, smiling gently, 'that I know what decision Imade and why I made it. I wanted to cease being a cybrid and become aman. I wanted to go to Hyperion. I still do."'Somebody killed you for that decision a week ago,' 1 said.'Yes."'And you're going to try again?"'Yes."'Why not invest consciousness in your cybrid here?Become human in the Web?"'It would never work,' said Johnny. 'What you see as a complexinterstellar society is only a small part of the Core reality matrix. Iwould be constantly confronted with and at the mercy of the Als. TheKeats persona...reality... would never survive."'All right,' I said, 'you need to get out of the Web. But there areother colonies. Why Hyperion?"Johnny took my hand. His finger were long and warm and strong. 'Don'tyou see, Brawne? There is some con-neetion here. It may well be thatKeats's dreams of Hyperion were some sort of transtemporal communicationbetween his then persona and his now persona. If nothing else, Hyperionis the key mystery of our age - physical and poetic - and it is quiteprobable that he... that I was born, died, and was born again toexplore it."'It sounds like madness to me,' I said. 'Delusions of grandeur."'Almost certainly,' laughed Johnny. 'And I never have been happier!" Hegrabbed my arms and brought me to my feet, his arms around me. 'Willyou go with me, Brawne? Go with me to Hyperion?"I blinked in surprise, both at his question and the answer, which filledme like a rush of warmth. 'Yes,' I said. 'I'11 go."We went into the sleeping area then and made love the rest of that day,sleeping finally to awaken to the low light of Shift Three in theindustrial trench outside.Johnny was lying on his back, his hazel eyes open and staring at theceiling, lost in thought. But not so lost he did not smile and put hisarm around me. I nestled my cheek against him, settling into the smallcurve where shoulder meets chest, and went back to sleep.I was wearing my best clothes - a suit of black whipcord, a blouse wovenof Renaissance silk with a Carvnel blood-stone at the throat, a cockedEulin Br6 tricorne - when Johnny and I farcast to TC2 the next day. Ileft him in the wood and brass bar near the central terminex, but notbefore I slid Dad's automatic across to him in a paper bag and told himto shoot anyone who even looked cross-eyed at him.'Web English is such a subtle tongue,' he said.'That phrase is older than the Web,' I said. 'Just do it." I squeezedhis hand and left without looking back.I took a skycab to the Administration Complex and walked my way throughabout nine security checks before they let me into the Center grounds. Iwalked the half klick across Deer Park, admiring the swans in the nearbylake and the white buildings on the hilltop in the distance, and thenthere were nine more checkpoints before a Center security woman led meup the flagstoned path to Government House, a low, graceful building setamid flower gardens and landscaped hills. There was an elegantlyfurnished waiting room but I barely had time to sit down on an authenticpre-Hegira de Kooning before an aide appeared and ushered me into theCEO's private office.Meina Gladstone came around the desk to shake my hand and show me to achair. It was strange to see her in person again after all those yearsof watching her on HTV. She was even more impressive in the flesh: herhair was cut short but seemed to be blowing back in gray-white waves;her cheeks and chin were as sharp and Lincolnesque as all thehistory-prone pundits insisted, but it was the large, sad, brown eyeswhich dominated the face and made one feel as if he or she were in thepresence of a truly original person.I found that my mouth was dry. 'Thank you for seeing me, M. Executive.I know how busy you are."'I'm never too busy to see you, Brawne. Just as your father was nevertoo busy to see me when I was a junior senator."I nodded. Dad had once described Meina Gladstone as the only politicalgenius in the Hegemony. He knew that she would be CEO someday despiteher late start in poli tics. I wished Dad had lived to see it.'How is your mother, Brawne?"'She's well, M. Executive. She rarely leaves our old summer place onFreeholm anymore but I see her every Christmas Fest."Gladstone nodded. She had been sitting casually on the edge of amassive desk which the tabloids said had once belonged to anassassinated President- not Lincoln - of the pre-Mistake USA, but nowshe smiled and went around to the simple chair behind it. 'I miss yourfather, Brawne. I wish he were in this administration.Did you see the lake when you came in?"'Yes."'Do you remember sailing toy boats there with my Kresten when you wereboth toddlers?"'Just barely, M. Executive. I was pretty young."Meina Gladstone smiled. An intercom chimed but she waved it intosilence. 'How can I help you, Brawne?"I took a breath. 'M. Executive, you may be aware that I'm working asan independent private investigator..." I didn't wait for her nod. 'Acase I've been working on recently has led me back to Dad's suicide..."'Brawne, you know that was investigated most thoroughly.I saw the commission's report."'Yeah,' I said. 'I did too. But recently l've discovered some verystrange things about the TechnoCore and its attitude toward the worldHyperion. Weren't you and Dad working on a bill that would have broughtHyperion into the Hegemony Protectorate?"Gladstone nodded. 'Yes, Brawne, but there were over a dozen othercolonies being considered that year. None were allowed in."'Right. But did the Core or the AI Advisory Council take a specialinterest in Hyperion?"The CEO tapped a stylus against her lower lip. 'What kind ofinformation do you have, Brawne?" I started to answer but she held up ablunt finger. 'Wait!" She keyed an interactive. 'Thomas, VII bestepping out for a few minutes. Please be sure that the Sol Draconitrade delegation is entertained if I fail a bit behind schedule."I didn't see her key anything else but suddenly a blue and goldfarcaster portai hummed into life near the far wall. She gestured me togo through first.A plain of gold, knee-high grass stretched to horizons which seemedfarther away than most. The sky was a pale yellow with burnished copperstreaks which may have been clouds. I didn't recognize the world.Meina Gladstone stepped through and touched the comlog design on hersleeve. The farcaster portal winked out. A warm breeze blew spicescents to us.Gladstone touched her sleeve again, glanced skyward, and nodded. 'I'msorry for the inconvenience, Brawne.Kastrop-Rauxel has no datasphere or sats of any kind.NOw please go ahead with what you were saying. What kind of informationhave you come across?"I looked around at the empty grasslands. 'Nothing to warrant thissecurity... probably. l've just discovered that the TechnoCore seemsvery interested in Hyperion.They've also built some sort of analog to Old Earth... an entireworld!'If I expected shock or surprise I was disappointed.Gladstone nodded. 'Yes. We know about the Old Earth analog."I was shocked. 'Then why hasn't it even been announced? If the Corecan rebuild Old Earth, a lot of people would be interested."Gladstone began walking and I strolled with her, walking faster to keepup with her long-legged strides.'Brawne, it would not be in the Hegemony's interest to announce it. Ourbest !uman intelligence sources have no idea why the Core is doing sucha thing. They have offered no insight. The best policy now is to wait.What information do you have about Hyperion?"I had no idea whether I could trust Meina Gladstone, old times or not.But I knew that if I was going to get information I would have to givesome. 'They built an analog reconstruction of an Old Earth poet,' Isaid, 'and they seem obsessed with keeping any information aboutHyperion away from him."Gladstone picked a long stem of grass and sucked on it.'The John Keats cybrid."'Yes." I was careful not to show surprise this time. 'I know that Dadwas pushing hard to get Protectorate status for Hyperion. If the Corehas some special interest in the place, they may have had something todo... may have manipulated..."'His apparent suicide?"'Yeah?"The wind moved gold grass in waves. Something very small scurried awayin the stalks at our feet. 'It is not beyond the realm of possibility,Brawne. But there was absolutely no evidence. Tell me what this cybridis going to do."'First tell me why the Core is so interested in Hyperion."The older woman spread her hands. 'If we knew that, Brawne, I wouldsleep much easier nights. As far as we know, the TechnoCore has beenobsessed with Hyperion for centuries. When CEO Yevshensky allowed KingBilly of Asquith to recolonize the planet, it almost precipitated a truesecession of AIs from the Web. Recently the establishment of ourfatline transmitter there brought about a similar crisis."'But the AIs didn't secede."'No, Brawne, it appears that, for whatever reason, they need us almostas badly as we need them."'But if they're so interested in Hyperion, why don't they allow it intothe Web so they can go there themselves?"Gladstone ran a hand through her hair. The bronze clouds far aboverippled in what must be a fantastic jet stream. 'They are adamant aboutHyperion not being admitted to the Web,' she said. 'It is aninteresting paradox.Tell me what the cybrid is going to do."'First tell me why the Core is obsessed with Hyperion." 'We do not knowfor sure." 'Best guess then."CEO Gladstone removed the stem of grass from her mouth and regarded it.'We believe that the Core is embarked on a truly incredible projectwhich would allow them to predict . . . everything. To handle everyvariable of space, time, and history as a quantum of manageableinformation."'Their Ultimate Intelligence Project,' I said, knowing that I was beingcareless and not caring.This time CEO Gladstone did register shock. 'How do you know aboutthat?"'What does that project have to do with Hyperion?" Gladstone sighed. 'Wedon't know for sure, Brawne.But we do know that there is an anomaly on Hyperion which they have notbeen able to factor into their predictive analyses. Do you know aboutthe so-called Time Tombs that the Shrike Church holds holy?"'Sure. They've been off limits to tourists for a while."'Yes. Because of an accident to a researcher there a few decades ago,our scientists have confirmed that the anti-entropic fields around theTombs are not merely a protection against time's erosive effects as hasbeen widely believed."'What are they?"'The remnants of a field... or force... which has actually propelledthe Tombs and their contents backward in time from some distant future."'Contents?" I managed. 'But the Tombs are empty.Ever since they were discovered."'Empty now,' said Meina Gladstone. 'But there is evidence that theywere full... will be full... when they open. In our near future."I stared at her. 'How near?"Her dark eyes remained soft but the movement of her head was final.'l've told you too much already, Brawne.You are forbidden to repeat it. We'll ensure that silence ifnecessary."I hid my own confusion by finding a piece of grass to strip for chewing.'All right,' I said. 'What's going to come out of the Tombs? Aliens?Bombs? Some sort of reverse time capsules?"Gladstone smiled tightly. 'If we knew that, Brawne, we would be aheadof the Core, and we are not." The smile disappeared. 'One hypothesis isthat the Tombs relate to some future war. A settling of future scoresby rearranging the past, perhaps."'A war between who, for Chrissakes?"She opened her hands again. 'We need to be getting back, Brawne. Wouldyou please tell me what the Keats cybrid is going to do now?"I looked down and then back up to meet her steady gaze. I couldn'ttrust anyone, but the Core and the Shrike Church already knew Johnny'splans. If this was a three-sided game, perhaps each side should know incase there was a good guy in the bunch, 'He's going to invest allconsciousness in the cybrid,' I said rather clumsily. 'He's going tobecome human, M. Gladstone, and then go to Hyperion. I'm going withhim."The CEO of the Senate and All Thing, chief officer for a governmentwhich spanned almost two hundred worlds and billions of people, staredat me in silence for along moment. Then she said, 'He plans to go with theTemplar ship on the pilgrimage then."'Yes."'No,' said Meina Gladstone.'What do you mean?"'I mean that the Sequoia Sempervirens will not be allowed to leaveHegemony space. There will be no pilgrimage unless the Senate decidesit is in our interest." Her voice was iron-hard.'Johnny and VII go by spinship,' I said. 'The pilgrimage is a loser'sgame anyway."'No,' she said. 'There will be no more civilian spin-ships to Hyperionfor some time."The word 'civilian' tipped me. 'War?"Gladstone's lips were tight. She nodded. 'Before mostspinships could reach the region."'A war with... the Ousters?"'Initially. View it as a way to force the issue between the TechnoCoreand ourselves, Brawne. We will either have to incorporate the Hyperionsystem into the Web to allow it FORCE protection, or it will fall to arace which despises and distrusts the Core and all Als."I didn't mention Johnny's comment that the Core had been in touch withthe Ousters. I said, 'A way to force the issue. Fine. But whomanipulated the Ousters into attacking?"Gladstone looked at me. If her face was Lincolnesque at that moment,then Old Earth's Lincoln was one tough son of a bitch. 'It's time toget back, Brawne. You appreciate how important it is that none of thisinformation gets out."'I appreciate the fact that you wouldn't have told me unless you had areason to,' I said. 'I don't know who you want the stuff to go to, butI know l'm a messenger, not a confidante."'Don't underestimate our resolve to keep this classified, Brawne."I laughed. 'Lady, I wouldn't underestimate your resolve in anything."Meina Gladstone gestured for me to step through the farcaster portalfirst.' I know a way we can discover what the Core is up to,' said Johnny aswe rode alone in a rented jetboat on MareI nfinitus. 'But it would be dangerous."'So what else is new?"'I'm serious. We should only attempt it if we feel that it isimperative to understand what the Core fears fromHyperion."'Ido."'We will need an operative. Someone who is an artist in datumplaneoperations. Someone smart but not so smart that they won't take achance. And someone who would risk everything and keep the secret justfor the ultimate in cyberpuke pranks."I grinned at Johnny. 'l'vegot just the man."BB lived alone in a cheap apartment at the base of a cheap tower in acheap TC2 neighborhood. But there was nothing cheap about the hardwarethat filled most of the space in the four-room flat. Most of BB'ssalary for the past standard decade had gone into state-of-the artcyberpuke toys.I started by saying that we wanted him to do something illegal. BB saidthat, as a public employee, he couldn't consider such a thing. He askedwhat the thing was. Johnny began to explain. BB leaned forward and Isaw the old cyberpuke gleam in his eyes from our college days. I halfexpected him to try to dissect Johnny right there just to see how acybrid worked. Then Johnny got to the interesting part and BB's gleamturned into a sort of green glow.'When I self-destruct my AI persona,' said Johnny, 'the shift to cybridconsciousness will take only nanoseconds, but during that time mysection of the Core perimeter defenses will drop. The security phageswill fill the gap before too many more nanoseconds pass, but during thetime..."'Entry to the Core,' whispered BB, his eyes glowing like some antiqueVDT.'It would be very dangerous,' stressed Johnny. 'To my knowledge, nohuman operator has ever penetrated Core periphery."BB rubbed his upper lip. 'There's a legend that CowboyGibson did it before the Core seceded,' he mumbled.'But nobody believes it. And Cowboy disappeared."'Even if you penetrate,' said Johnny, 'there would be insufficient timeto access except for the fact that I have the data coordinates."'Fan-fucking-tastic,' whispered BB. He turned backto his console and reached for his shunt. 'Let's do it." 'Now?" I said.Even Johnny looked taken aback.'Why wait?" BB clicked in his shunt and attached metacortex leads, butleft the deck idling. 'Are we doing this, or what?"I went over next to Johnny on the couch and took his hand. His skin wascool. He showed no expression now but I could imagine what it must belike to be facing imminent destruction of one's personality and previousexistence. Even if the transfer worked, the human withthe John Keats persona would not be 'Johnny."'He's right,' said Johnny. 'Why wait?"I kissed him. 'All right,' I said. 'l'm going in with BB."'No!" Johnny squeezed my hand. 'You can't help and the danger would beterrible."I heard my own voice, as implacable as Meina Gladstone's. 'Perhaps. ButI can't ask BB to do this if I won't. And I won't leave you in therealone." I squeezed his hand a final time and went over to sit by BB atthe console. 'How do I connect with this fucking thing, BB?"You've read all the cyberpuke stuff. You know all about the terriblebeauty of datumplane, the three-dimensional highways with theirlandscapes of black ice and neon perimeters and Day-Glo Strange Loopsand shimmering skyscrapers of data blocks under hovering clouds of AIpresence. I saw all of it riding piggyback on BB's carrier wave. Itwas almost too much. Too intense. Too terrifying.I could hear the black threats of the hulking security phages; I couldsmell death on the breath of the counterthrust tapeworm viruses eventhrough the ice screens; I could feel the weight of the AIs' wrath aboveus- we were insects under elephants' feet- and we hadn't even doneanything yet except travel approved dataways on a logged-in accesserrand BB had dreamed up, some homework stuff for his Flow ControlRecords and Statistics job.And I was wearing stick-on leads, seeing things in a datumplane versionof fuzzy black and white TV while Johnny and BB were viewing fullstimsim holo, as it were.I don't know how they took it.'OK,' whispered BB in some datumplane equivalent of a whisper, 'we'rehere."'Where?" All I saw was an infinite maze of bright lights and evenbrighter shadows, ten thousand cities arrayed in four dimensions.'Core periphery,' whispered BB. 'Hang on. It's about time."I had no arms to hang on with and nothing physical in this universe tograsp, but I concentrated on thewaveform shades that were our data truck and clung.Johnny died then.I've seen a nuclear explosion firsthand. When Dad was a senator he tookMom and me to Olympus Command School to see a FORCE demonstration. Forthe last course the audience viewing pod was farcast to some godforsakenworld . . . Armaghast, I think . . . and a FORCE:ground reconplatoon fired a clean tactical nuke at a pretend adversary some nineklicks away. The viewing pod was shielded with a class ten containmentfield, polarized, the nuke only a fifty-kiloton field tactical, but I'llnever forget the blast, the shock wave rocking the eighty-ton pod like aleaf on its repellers, the physical shock of light so obscenely brightthat it polarized our field to midnight and still brought tears to oureyes andclamored to get in.This was worse.A section of datumplane seemed to flash and then to implode on itself,reality flushed down a drain of pure black.'Hang on!" BB screamed against datumplane static that rasped at my bonesand we were whirling, tumbling, sucked into the vacuum like insects inan oceanic vortex.Somehow, incredibly, impossibly, black-armored phages thrust toward usthrough the din and madness.BB avoided one, turned the other's acid membranes against itself. Wewere being sucked into something colder and blacker than any void in ourreality could ever be.'There!" called BB, his voice analog almost lost in the tornado rush ofripping datasphere.There what? Then I saw it: a thin line of yellow rippling in theturbulence like a cloth banner in a hurricane.BB rolled us, found our own wave to carry us against the storm, matchedcoordinates that danced past me too quickly to see, and we were ridingthe yellow band into... . . into what? Frozen fountains of fireworks. Transparent mountainranges of data, endless glaciers of ROMworks, access ganglia spreadinglike fissures, iron clouds of semisentient internal pro:ess bubbles,glowing pyramids of primary source stuff, each guarded by lakesof black ice and armies of black-pulse pilages.'Shit,' I whispered to no one in particular.BB followed the yellow band down, in, through. I felt a connection asif someone had suddenly given us a great mass to carry.'Got it)." screamed BB, and suddenly there was a sound louder and largerthan the maelstrom of noise surrounding and consuming us. It wasneither klaxon nor siren, but it was both in its tone of warning andaggression.We were climbing out of it all. I could see a vague wall of graythrough the brilliant chaos and somehow knew it to be the periphery, thevacuum dwindling but still breaching the wall like a shrinking blackstain. We were climbing out.But not quickly enough.The phages hit us from five sides. During the twelve years I've been aninvestigator I've been shot once, knifed twice l'd had more than thisone rib broken. This hurt more than all that combined. BB was fightingand climbing at the same time.My contribution to the emergency was to scream. I felt cold claws onus, pulling us down, back into the brightness and noise and chaos BBwas using some program, some formula of enchantment to fight themoff. But not enough. I could feel the blows slamming home - notagainst me primarily, but connecting to the matrix analog that was BB.We were sinking back. Inexorable forces had us in tow. Suddenly I feltJohnny's presence and it was as if a huge, strong hand had scooped usup, lifted us through the periphery wall an instant before the stainsnapped our lifeline to existence and the defensive field crashedtogether like steel teeth.We moved at impossible speed down congested data-ways, passingdatumplane couriers and other operator analogs like an EMV ripping pastoxcarts. Then we were approaching a slow-time gate, leapfrogginggridlocked exiting operator analogs in some four-dimensional high jump.I felt the inevitable nausea of transition as we came out of the matrix.Light burned my retinas. Real light. Then the pain washed in and Islumped over the console and groaned.'Come on, Brawne." It was Johnny - or someone just like Johnny - helpingme to my feet and moving us both toward the door.'BB,' I gasped.' No. 'I opened aching eyes long enough to see BB Surbringer draped across hisconsole. His Stetson had fallen off and rolled to the floor. BB's headhad exploded, spattering most of the console with gray and red. Hismouth was open and a thick white foam still issued from it. It lookedlike his eyes had melted.Johnny caught me, half lifted me. 'We have to go,' he whispered.'Someone will be here any minute."I closed my eyes and let him take me away from there.I awoke to dim red light and the sound of water dripping.I smelled sewage, mildew, and the ozone of uninsulated power cables. Iopened one eye.We were in a low space more cave than room with cables snaking from ashattered ceiling and pools of water on the slime-caked tiles. The redlight came from somewhere beyond the cave- a maintenance accessshaft perhaps, or automech tunnel. I moaned softly.Johnny was there, moving from the rough bedroll of blankets to my side.His face was darkened with greaseor dirt and there was at least one fresh cut.'Where are we?"He touched my cheek. His other arm went around my shoulders and helpedme to a sitting position. The awful view shifted and tilted and for amoment I thought I was going to be sick. Johnny helped me drink waterfrom a plastic tumbler.'Dregs' Hive,' said Johnny.l'd guessed even before I was fully conscious. Dregs' Hive is thedeepest pit on Lusus, a no man's land of mech tunnels and illegalburrows occupied by half the Web's outcasts and outlaws. It was inDregs' Hive that I'd been shot several years ago and still bore thelaser scar above my left hipbone.I held the tumbler out for more water. Johnny fetched some from a steeltherm and came back. I panicked for a second as I fumbled in my tunicpocket and on my belt: Dad's automatic was gone. Johnny held the weaponup and I relaxed, accepting the cup and drinking thirstily.'BB?" I said, hoping for a moment that it had all been a terriblehallucination.Johnny shook his head. 'There were defenses that neither of us hadanticipated. BB's incursion was brilliant, but he couldn't outrightCore omega phages. But half the operators in datumplane felt echoes ofthe battle. BB is already the stuff of legend."'Fucking great,' I said and gave a laugh that sounded suspiciously likethe beginning of a sob. 'The stuff of legend. And BB's dead. Forfuck-all nothing."Johnny's arm was tight around me. 'Not for nothing, Brawne. He madethe grab. And passed the data to me before he died."I managed to sit fully upright and to look at Johnny.He seemed the same- the same soft eyes, same hair, same voice. Butsomething was subtly different, deeper.More human? 'You?" I said. 'Did you make the transfer?Are you..."'Human?" John Keats smiled at me. 'Yes, Brawne. Oras close to human as someone forged in the Core could ever be."'But you remember ... me ... BB ... what's happened."'Yes. And I remember first looking into Chapman's Homer. And mybrother Tom's eyes as he hemorrhaged in the night. And Severn's kindvoice when I was too weak to open my own eyes to face my fate. And ournight in Piazza di Spagna when I touched your lips and imagined Fanny'scheek against mine. I remember, Brawne."For a second I was confused, and then hurt, but then he set his palmagainst my cheek and he touched me, there was no one else, and Iunderstood. I closed my eyes. 'Why are we here?" I whispered againsthis shirt.'I couldn't risk using a farcaster. The Core could trace us at once. Iconsidered the spaceport but you were in no condition to travel. Ichose the Dregs'."I nodded against him. 'They'll try to kill you."'Yes."'Are the local cops after us? The Hegemony police?Transit cops?"'No, I don't think so. The only ones who're challenged us so far weretwo bands of goondas and some of the Dregs' dwellers."I opened my eyes. 'What happened with the goondas?" There were moredeadly hoodlums and contract killers in the Web but I'd never run acrossany.Johnny held up Dad's automatic and smiled.'I don't remember anything after BB,' I said.'You were injured by the phage backlash. You could walk but we were thecause of more than a few odd looks in the Concourse."'I bet. Tell me about what BB discovered. Why is the Core obsessedwith Hyperion?"'Eat first,' said Johnny. 'It's been more than twenty-eight hours." Hecrossed the dripping width of the cave room and returned with aself-heating packet. It was basic hoio fanatic fare - flash-dried andreheated cloned beef, potatoes which had never seen soil, and carrotswhich looked like some sort of deep-sea slugs. Nothing had ever tastedso good.'OK,' I said, 'tell me."'The TechnoCore has been divided into three groups for as long as theCore has existed,' said Johnny. 'The Stables are the old-line Als, someof them dating back to pre-Mistake days; at least one of them gainedsentience in the First Information Age. The Stables argue that acertain level of symbiosis is necessary between humanity and the Core.They've promoted the Ultimate Intelligence Project as a way to avoidrash decisions, to delay until all variables can be factored. TheVolatiles are the force behind the Secession three centuries ago. TheVola-tiles have done conclusive studies that show how humankind'susefulness is past and from this point on human beings constitute athreat to the Core. They advocate immediate and total extinction."'Extinction,' I said. After a moment I asked, 'Can they do it?"'Of humans in the Web, yes,' said Johnny. 'Core intelligences not onlycreate the infrastructure for Hegemony society but are necessary foreverything from FORCE deployment to the failsafes on stockpiled nuclearand plasma arsenals."'Did you know about this when you were... in the Core?"'No,' said Johnny. 'As a pseudo-poet cybrid retrieval project, I was afreak, a pet, a partial thing allowed to roam the Web the way a pet islet out of the house each day. I had no idea there were three camps ofAI influence."'Three camps,' I said. 'What's the third? And where does Hyperion comein?"'Between the Stables and the Volatiles are the Ultimates.For the past five centuries the Ultimates have been obsessed with the UIProject. The existence or extinction of the human race is of interestto them only in how it applies to the project. To this date, they havebeen a force for moderation, an ally of the Stables, because it is theirperception that such reconstruction and retrieval projects as the OldEarth experiment are necessary to the culmination of the UI.'Recently, however, the Hyperion issue has caused the Ultimates to movetoward the Volatiles' views. Since Hyperion was explored four centuriesago, the Core has been concerned and nonplussed. It was immediatelyobvious that the so-called Time Tombs were artifacts launched backwardin time from a point at least ten thousand years in the galaxy's future.More disturbing, however, is the fact that Core predictive formulae havenever been able to factor the Hyperion variable.'Brawne, to understand this, you must realize how much the Core reliesupon prediction. Already, without UI input, the Core knows the detailsof the physical, human, and AI future to a margin of 98.9995 percent fora period of at least two centuries. The AI Advisory Council to the AllThing with its vague, delphic utterancesconsidered so indispensable byhumans- is a joke. The Core drops tidbits of revelations to theHegemony when it serves the Core's purposes - sometimes to aid theVolatiles, sometimes the Stables, but always to please the Ultimates.'Hyperion is a rent in the entire predictive fabric of the Core'sexistence. It is the penultimate oxymoron- a nonfactorable variable.Impossible as it seems, Hyperion appears to be exempt from the laws ofphysics, history, human psychology, and AI prediction as practiced bythe Core.'The result has been two futures - two realities if you will- one inwhich the Shrike scourge soon to be released on the Web and interstellarhumanity is a weapon from the Core-dominated future, a retroactive firststrike from the Volatiles who rule the galaxy millennia hence. Theother reality sees the Shrike invasion, the coming interstellar war, andthe other products of the Time Tombs' opening as a human fist struckback through time, a final, twilight effort by the Ousters,ex-colonials, and other small bands of humans who escaped the Volatiles'extinction programs."Water dripped on tile. Somewhere in the tunnels nearby a mechcauterizer's warning siren echoed from ceramic and stone. I leanedagainst the wall and stared at Johnny.'Interstellar war,' I said. 'Both scenarios demand an interstellarwar?"'Yes. There is no escaping that."'Can both Core groups be wrong in their prediction?" 'No. What happenson Hyperion is problematic, but the disruption in the Web and elsewhereis quite clear.The Ultimates use this knowledge as the prime argument for hurrying thenext step in Core evolution."'And what did BB's stolen data show about us, Johnny?"Johnny smiled, touched my hand, but did not hold it.'It showed that I am somehow part of the Hyperion unknown. Theircreation of a Keats cybrid was a terrible amble. Only my apparent lackof success as a Keats analog allowed the Stables to preserve me. When Imade up my mind to go to Hyperion, the Volatiles killed me with theclear intention of obliterating my AI existence ifmy cybrid again made that decision."'You did. What happened?"'They failed. In the Co.re's limitless arrogance, they failed to taketwo things into account. First, that I might invest all consciousnessin my cybrid and thus change the nature of the Keats analog. Second,that I would go to you."'Me!'He took my hand. 'Yes, Brawne. It seems that you also are part of theHyperion unknown."I shook my head. Realizing that there was a numbness in my scalp aboveand behind my left ear, I raised my hand, half expecting to find damagefrom the datumplane fight. Instead, my fingers encountered the plasticof a neural shunt socket.I jerked my other hand from Johnny's grasp and stared at him in horror.He'd had me wired while I was unconscious.Johnny held up both hands, palms toward me. 'I had to, Brawne. It maybe necessary for the survival of both of us."I made a fist. 'You fucking low-life son of a bitch.Why do I need to interface directly, you lying bastard?"'Not with the Core,' Johnny said softly. 'With me."'You?" My arm and fist quivered with the anticipation of smashing hisvat-cloned face. 'You!" I sneered.'You're human now remember?"'Yes. But certain cybrid functions remain. Do you remember when Itouched your hand several days ago and brought us to datumplane?"I stared at him. 'I'm not going to datumplane again." 'No. Nor am I.But I may need to relay incredible amounts of data to you within a veryshort period of time. I brought you to a black market surgeon in theDregs' last night. She implanted a SchrOn loop."'Why?" The SchrOn loop was tiny, no larger than my thumbnail, and veryexpensive. It held countless field-bubble memories, each capable ofholding near infinite bits of information. $chrOn loops could not beaccessed by the biological carrier and thus were used for courierpurposes. ^ man or woman could carry AI personalities or entireplanetary dataspheres in a Schrn loop. Hell, a dog could carry allthat.'Why?" I said again, wondering if Johnny or some forces behind Johnnywere using me as such a courier.'Why?"Johnny moved closer and put his hand around my fist.'Trust me, Brawne."I don't think I'd trusted anyone since Dad blew his brains out twentyyears ago and Mom retreated into the pure selfishness of her seclusion.There was no reason inthe universe to trust Johnny now.But I did.I relaxed my fist and took his hand.'All right,' said Johnny. 'Finish your meal and we'll get busy tryingto save our lives."Weapons and drugs were the two easiest things to buy in Dregs' Hive. Wespent the last of Johnny's considerable stash of black marks to buyweapons.By 2200 hours, we each wore whiskered titan-poly body armor. Johnny hada goonda's mirror-black helmet and I wore a FORCE-surplus command mask.Johnny's power gauntlets were massive and a bright red.I wore osmosis gloves with killing trim. Johnny carriedan Ouster hellwhip captured on Bressia and had tucked a laser wand inhis belt. Along with Dad's automatic, I now carried a Steiner-Ginnmini-gun on a gyroed waist brace. It was slaved to my command visor andI could keep both hands free while firing.Johnny and I looked at each other and began giggling.When the laughter stopped there was a long silence.'Are you sure the Shrike Temple here on Lusus is our best chance?" Iasked for the third or fourth time."'We can't farcast,' said Johnny. 'All the Core has to do is record amalfunction and we're dead. We can't even take an elevator from thelower levels. We'll have to find unmonitored stairways and climb thehundred and twenty floors. The best chance to make the Temple isstraight down the Concourse Mall."'Yes, but will the Shrike Church people take us in?" Johnny shrugged, astrangely insectoid gesture in his combat outfit. The voice through thegoonda helmet was metallic. 'They're the only group which has a vestedinterest in our survival. And the only ones with enough political pullto shield us from the Hegemony while finding transit for us toHyperion."I pushed up my visor. 'Meina Gladstone said that no future pilgrimageflights to Hyperion would be allowed."The dome of mirror black nodded judiciously. 'Well, fuck MeinaGladstone,' said my poet lover.I took a breath and walked to the opening of our niche, our cave, ourlast sanctuary. Johnny came up behind me. Body armor rubbed againstbody armor.'Ready, Brawne?"I nodded, brought the mini-gun around on its pivot, and started toleave.Johnny stopped me with a touch. 'I love you, Brawne."I nodded, still tough. I forgot that my visor was up and he could seemy tears.The Hive is awake all twenty-eight hours of the day, but through sometradition, Third Shift was the quietest, the least populated. We wouldhave had a better chance at the height of First Shift rush hour alongthe pedestriancauseways. But if the goondas and thuggees were waiting for us, thedeath toll of civilians would have been staggering.It took us more than three hours to climb our way to Concourse Mall, notup a single staircase but along an endless series of mech corridors,abandoned access verticals swept clean by the Luddite riots eighty yearsago, and a final stairway that was more rust than metal. We exited ontoa delivery corridor less than half a klick from the Shrike Temple.'I can't believe it was so easy,' I whispered to him on intercom.'They are probably concentrating people on the space-port and privatefarcaster clusters."We took the least exposed walkway onto the Concourse, thirty metersbelow the first shopping level and four hundred meters below the roof.The Shrike Temple was an ornate, free-stranding structure now less thanhalf a klick away. A few off-hour shoppers and joggers glanced at usand then moved quickly away. I had no doubt that the Mall police werebeing paged, but I'd be surprised if they showed up too quickly.A gang of brightly painted street thugs exploded from a lift shaft,hollering and whooping. They carried pulse-knives, chains, and powergauntlets. Startled, Johnny wheeled toward them with the hellwhipsending out a score of targeting beams. The mini-gun whir-whirred outof my hands, shifting from aiming point to aiming point as I moved myeyes.The gang of seven kids skidded to a halt, held up their hands, andbacked away, eyes wide. They dropped into the lift shaft and were gone.I looked at Johnny. Black mirrors looked back. Neither of us laughed.We crossed to the northbound shopping lane. The few pedestriansscurried for open shopfronts. We were less than a hundred meters fromthe Temple stairs. I could actually hear my heartbeat in the FORCEhelmet ear-phones.We were within fifty meters of the stairs. As if called, an acolyte orpriest of some sort appeared at the ten-meter door of the Temple andwatched us approach.Thirty meters. If anyone was going to intercept us, they would havedone it before this.I turned toward Johnny to say something funny. At least twenty beamsand half that many projectiles hit us at once. The outer layer of thetitan-poly exploded outward, deflecting most of the projectile energy inthe counterblast. rhe mirrored surface beneath bounced most of thekilling light. Most of it.Johnny was flung off his feet by the impact. I went to one knee and letthe mini-gun train on the laser source.Ten stories up along the residential Hive wall. My visor opaqued. Bodyarmor burned off in a steam of reflective gas. The mini-gun soundedprecisely like the kind' of chainsaw they used in history hoiodramas.Ten stories up, a five-meter section of balcony and wall disintegratedin a cloud of explosive flchettes and armor-piercing rounds.Three heavy slugs struck me from behind.I landed on my palms, silenced the mini-gun, and swiveled. There wereat least a dozen of them on each level, moving quickly in precise combatchoreography.Johnny had reached his knees and was firing the hell-whip inorchestrated bursts of light, working his way through the rainbow tobeat bounce defenses.One of the running figures exploded into flame as the shopwindow behindit turned to molten glass and spattered fifteen meters onto theConcourse. Two more men came up over the level railings and I sent themback with a burst from the mini-gun.An open skimmer came down from the rafters, repellers laboring as itbanked around pylons. Rocket fire slammed into concrete around Johnnyand me. Shop-fronts vomited a billion shards of glass over us. Ilooked, blinked twice, targeted, and fired. The skimmer lurchedsideways, struck an escalator with a dozen cowering civilians on it, andtumbled in a mass of twisting metal and exploding ordnance. I saw oneshopper leap in flames to the Hive floor eighty meters below.'Left!" shouted Johnny over the tightbeam intercom.Four men in combat armor had dropped from an upper level using personallift packs. The polymerized chameleon armor labored to keep up with theshifting Iackground but only succeeded in turning each man into abrilliant kaleidoscope of reflections. One moved inside the sweep archof my mini-gun to neutralize me while the other three went for Johnny.He came in with a pulse-blade, ghetto style. I let it chew at my armor,knowing it would get through to forearm flesh but using it to buy thesecond I needed. I got it. I killed the man with the rigid edge of mygauntlet and swept the mini-gun fire into the three worrying Johnny.Their armor went rigid and I used the gun to sweep them backward likesomeone hosing down a littered sidewalk.Only one of the men got to his feet before I blew them all off the leveloverhang.Johnny was down again. Parts of his chest armor were gone, melted away.I smelled cooking flesh but saw no mortal wounds. I half crouched,lifted him.'Leave me, Brawne. Run. The stairs." The tightbeam was breaking up.'Fuck off,' I said, getting my left arm around him enough to support himwhile allowing room for the mini-gun to track. 'l'm still getting paidto be your bodyguard."They were sniping at us from both walls of the Hive, the rafters, andthe shopping levels above us. I counted at least twenty bodies on thewalkways; about half were brightly clad civilians. The power assist onthe left leg of my armor was grinding. Straight-legged, I awkwardlypulled us another ten meters toward the Temple stairs.There were several Shrike priests at the head of the stairs now,seemingly oblivious to the gunfire all around them.'Above!'I swiveled, targeted, and fired in one moment, hearing the gun go emptyafter one burst and seeing the second skimmer get off its missiles inthe instant before it became a thousand pieces of hurtling, unrelatedmetal and torn flesh. I dropped Johnny heavily to the pavement and fellon him, trying to cover his exposed flesh with my body.The missiles detonated simultaneously, several inairburst and at least two burrowing. Johnny and I were lifted into theair and hurled fifteen or twenty meters down the pitching walkway. Goodthing. The alloy and ferroconcrete pedestrian strip where we had been asecond before burned, bubbled, sagged, and tumbled down onto the flamingwalkway below. There was a natural moat there now, a gap between mostof the other ground troops and us.I rose, slapped away the useless mini-gun and mount, pulled off uselessshards of my own armor, and lifted Johnny in both arms. His helmet hadbeen blown off and his face was very bad. Blood seeped through a scoreof gaps in his armor. His right arm and left foot had been blown off. Iturned and began carrying him up the Shrike Temple stairs.There were sirens and security skimmers filling the Concourse flyspacenow. The goondas on the upper levels and far side of the tumbledwalkway ran for cover.Two of the commandos who had dropped on lift packs ran up the stairsafter me. I did not turn. I had to lift my straight and useless leftleg for every step. I knew that I had been seriously burned on my backand side and there were shrapnel wounds elsewhere.The skimmers whooped and circled but avoided the Temple steps. Gunfirerattled up and down the Mall. I could hear metal-shod footsteps comingrapidly behind me. I managed another three steps. Twenty steps above,impossibly far away, the bishop stood amid a hundred Temple priests.I made another step and looked down at Johnny. One eye was open,staring up at me. The other was closed with blood and swollen tissue.'It's all right,' I whispered, aware for the first time that my ownhelmet was gone. 'It's all right. We're almost there." I managed onemore step.The two men in bright black combat armor blocked my way. Both hadlifted visors streaked with deflection scars and their faces were veryhard.'Put him down, bitch, and maybe we'll let you live."I nodded tiredly, too tired to take another step or do anything butstand there and hold him in both arms.Johnny's blood dripped on white stone.'I said, put the son of a bitch down and..."I shot both of them, one in the left eye and one in the right, neverlifting Dad's automa(ic from where I held it under Johnny's body.They fell away. I managed another step. And then another. I rested abit and then lifted my foot for another.At the top of the stairs the group of black and red robes parted. Thedoorway was very tall and very dark. I did not look back but I couldhear from the noise behind us that the crowd on the Concourse was verylarge. The bishop walked by my side as I went through the doors andinto the dimness.I laid Johnny on the cool floor. Robes rustled around us. I pulled myown armor off where I could, then batted at Johnny's. It was fused tohis flesh in several places.I touched his burned cheek with my good hand. 'I'm sorry..."Johnny's head stirred slightly and his eye opened. He lifted his bareleft hand to touch my cheek, my hair, the back of my head. 'Fanny..."I felt him die then. I also felt the surge as his hand found the neuralshunt, the white-light warmth of the surge to the Schrn loop aseverything Johnny Keats ever was or would be exploded into me; almost,almost it was like his orgasm inside me two nights earlier, the surgeand throb and sudden warmth and stillness after, with the echo ofsensation there.I lowered him to the floor and let the acolytes remove the body, takingit out to show the crowd and the authorities and the ones who waited toknow.I let them take me away.I spent two weeks in a Shrike Temple recovery crche.Burns healed, scars removed, alien metal extracted, skin grafted, fleshregrown, nerves rewoven. And still I hurt.Everyone except the Shrike priests lost interest in me.The Core made sure that Johnny was dead; that his presence in the Corehad left no trace; that his cybrid was dead.The authorities took my statement, revoked my license, and coveredthings up as best they could. The Web press reported that a battlebetween Dregs' Level Hive gangs had erupted onto the Concourse Mail.Numerous gtng members and innocent bystanders were killed. The policecontained it.A week before word came that the Hegemony would allow the Yggdrasill tosail with pilgrims for the war zone near Hyperion, I used a Templefarcaster to 'cast to Renaissance Vector where I spent an hour alone inthe archives there.The papers were in vacuum-press so I could not touch them. Thehandwriting was Johnny's; I had seen his writing before. The parchmentwas yellow and brittle with age. There were two fragments. The firstread:The day is gone, and all its sweets are gone!Sweet voice, sweet lips, soft hand, and softer breast, Warm breath,light whisper, tender semi-tone,Bright eyes, accomplished shape, and languorous waist.tFaded the flower and all its budded charms,Faded the sight of beauty from my eyes,Faded the shape of beauty from my arms,Faded the voice, warmth, whiteness, paradisem Vanished unseasonably atshut of eve,When the dusk holiday - or holinight- Of fragrant-curtained love beginsto weaveThe woof of darkness thick, for hid delight;But, as I've read iove's missal through today,He'll let me sleep, seeing I fast and pray.The second fragment was in a wilder hand and on rougher paper, as ifslashed across a notepad in haste:This living hand, now warm and capableOf earnest grasping, would, if it were coldAnd in the icy silence of the tomb,So haunt thy days and chill thy dreaming nightsThat thou wouldst wish thine own heart dry of bloodSo in my veins red life might stream again,And thou be conscience-calm'd - see here it is- I hoM it towards youI'm pregnant. I think that Johnny knew it. I don't know for sure.I'm pregnant twice. Once with Johnny's child and once with theSchr6n-loop memory of what he was. I don't know if the two are meant tobe linked. It will be months before the child is born and only daysbefore I face the Shrike.But I remember those minutes after Johnny's torn body was taken out tothe crowd and before I was led away for help. They were all there inthe darkness, hundreds of the priests and acolytes and exorcists andostiaries and worshipers... and as one voice they began to chant, therein that red dimness under the revolving sculpture of the Shrike, andtheir voices echoed in Gothic vaults. And what they chanted wentsomething like this:'BLESSED BE SHEBLESSED BE THE MOTHER OF OURSALVATIONBLESSED BE THE INSTRUMENT OF OURATONEMENTBLESSED BE THE BRIDE OF OUR CREATION BLESSED BE SHE'I was injured and in shock. I didn't understand it then.I don't understand it now.But I know that, when the time arrives and the Shrike comes, Johnny andI will face it together.It was long after dark. The tramcar rode between stars and ice. Thegroup sat in silence, the only sound the creak of cable.After a time had passed, Lenar Hoyt said to Brawne Lamia, 'You alsocarry the cruciform."Lamia looked at the priest.Colonel Kassad leaned toward the woman. 'Do you think Het Masteen wasthe Templar who had spoken to Johnny?"'Possibly,' said Brawne Lamia. 'I never found out."Kassad did not blink. 'Were you the one who killedMasteen?"'No."Martin Silenus stretched and yawned. 'We have a few hours beforesunrise,' he said. 'Anyone else interested in getting some sleep?"Several heads nodded.'I'11 stay up to keep watch,' said Fedmahn Kassad.'I'm not tired."'I'll keep you company,' said the Consul.'I'll heat some coffee for the therm,' said Brawne Lamia.When the others slept, the infant Rachel making soft cooing sounds inher sleep, the other three sat at the windows and watched the stars burncold and distant in the high night.SIXChronos Keep jutted from the easternmost rim of the great Bridle Range:a grim, baroque heap of sweating stones with three hundred rooms andhalls, a maze of lightless corridors leading to deep halls, towers,turrets, balconies overlooking the northern moors, airshafts rising halfa kilometer to light and rumored to drop to the world's labyrinthitself, parapets scoured by cold winds from the peaks above, stairways-inside and out-carved from the mountain stone and leading nowhere,stained-glass windows a hundred meters tall set to catch the first raysof solstice sun or the moon on midwinter night, paneless windows thesize of a man's fist looking out on nothing in particular, an endlessarray of bas-relief, grotesque sculptures in half-hidden niches, andmore than a thousand gargoyles staring down from eave and parapet,transept and sepulcher, peering down through wood rafters in the greathalls and positioned so as to peer in the blood-tinted windows of thenortheast face, their winged and hunchbacked shadows moving like grimsundial hours, cast by sunlight in the day and gas-fed torches at night.And everywhere in Chronos Keep, signs of the Shrike Church's longoccupation -atonement altars draped in red velvet, hanging andfree-standing sculptures of the Avatar with polychrome steel for bladesand bloodgems for eyes, more statues of the Shrike carved from the stoneof narrow stairways and dark halls so that nowhere in the night wouldone be free of the fear of touching hands emerging from rock, the sharpcurve of blade descending from stone, four arms enveloping in a finalembrace. As if in a last measure of ornamentation, a filigree of bloodin many of the once occupied halls and rooms, arabesquesof red spattered in almost recognizable patterns along walls and tunnelceilings, bedclothes caked hard with rust-red substance, and a centraldining hall filled with the stench of food rotting from a meal abandonedweeks earlier, the floor and table, chairs and wall adorned with blood,stained clothing and shredded robes lying in mute heaps. And everywherethe sound of flies.'Jolly fucking place, isn't it?" said Martin Silenus, his voice echoing.Father Hoyt took several steps deeper into the great hall. Afternoonlight from the west-facing skylight forty meters above fell in dustycolumns. 'It's incredible,' he whispered. 'St Peter's in the NewVatican is nothing like this."Martin Silenus laughed. Thick light outlined his cheekbones and satyr'sbrows. 'This was built for a living deity,' he said.Fedmahn Kassad lowered his travel bag to the floor and cleared histhroat. 'Surely this place predates the Shrike Church."'It does,' said the Consul. 'But they've occupied it for the past twocenturies."'It doesn't look too occupied now,' said Brawne Lamia. She held herfather's automatic in her left hand.They had all shouted during their first twenty minutes in the Keep, butthe dying echoes, silences, and buzz of flies in the dining hall hadreduced them to silence.'Sad King Billy's androids and bond clones built the goddamn thing,'said the poet. 'Eight local years of labor before the spinshipsarrived. It was supposed to be the greatest tourist resort in the Web,the jumping-off point for the Time Tombs and the City of Poets. But lsuspect that even then the poor schmuck android laborers knew thelocals' version of the Shrike story."Sol Weintraub stood near an eastern window, holding his daughter up sothat soft light fell across her cheek and curled fist. 'All thatmatters little now,' he said. 'Let's find a corner free of carnagewhere we can sleep and eat our evening meal."'Are we going on tonight?" asked Brawne Lamia.'To the Tombs?" asked Silenus, showing real surprise for the first timeon the voyage. 'You'd go to the Shrike in the dark?"Lamia shrugged. 'What difference does it make?" The Consul stood near aleaded glass door leading to a stone balcony and closed his eyes. Hisbody still lurched and balanced to the movement of the tramcar. Thenight and day of travel above the peaks had blurred together in hismind, lost in the fatigue of almost three days without sleep and hisrising tension. He opened his eyes before he dozed off standing up.'We're tired,' he said. 'We'll stay here tonight and go down in themorning."Father Hoyt had gone out onto the narrow ledge of balcony. He leaned ona railing of jagged stone. 'Can we see the Tombs from here?"'No,' said Silenus. 'They're beyond that rise of hills.But see those white things to the north and west a bit...those things gleaming like shards of broken teeth in the sand?"'Yes."'That's the City of Poets. King Billy's original site for Keats and forall things bright and beautiful. The localssay that it's haunted now by headless ghosts."'Are you one of them?" asked Lamia.Martin Silenus turned to say something, looked a moment at the pistolstill in her hand, shook his head, and turned away.Footsteps echoed from an unseen curve of staircase and Colonel Kassadreentered the room. 'There are two small storerooms above the dininghall,' he said. 'They have a section of balcony outside but no otheraccess than this stairway. Easy to defend. The rooms are...clean. 'Silenus laughed. 'Does that mean nothing can get at us or that, whensomething does get at us, we'll have no way to get out?"'Where would we go?" asked Sol Weintraub.'Where indeedT' said the Consul. He was very tired.He lifted his gear and took one handle of the heavy M6bius cube, waitingfor Father Hoyt to lift the other end. 'Let's do what Kassad says. Finda space to spendthe night. Let's at least get out of this room. It stinks of death."Dinner was the last of their dried rations, some wine from Silenus'slast bottle, and some stale cake which Sol Weintraub had brought alongto celebrate their last evening together. Rachel was too little to eatthe cake, but she took her milk and went to sleep on her stomach on amat near her father.Lenar Hoyt removed a small balalaika from his pack and strummed a fewchords.'I didn't know you played,' said Brawne Lamia.'Poorly."The Consul rubbed his eyes. 'I wish we had a piano." 'You do have one,'said Martin Silenus.The Consul looked at the poet.'Bring it here,' said Silenus. 'I'd welcome a Scotch."'What are you talking about?" snapped Father Hoyt.'Make sense."'His ship,' said Silenus. 'Do you remember our dear, departed Voice ofthe Bush Masteen telling our Consul friend that h/s secret weapon wasthat nice Hegemony singleship sitting back at Keats Spaceport? Call itup, Your Consulship. Bring it on in."Kassad moved away from the stairway where he had been placing tripbeams.'The planet's datasphere is dead. The comsats are down. The orbitingFORCE ships are on tightbeam. How is he supposed to call it?"It was Lamia who spoke. 'A fatline transmitter." The Consul moved hisstare to her.'Fatline transmitters are the size of buildings,' said Kassad.Brawne Lamia shrugged. 'What Masteen said made sense. If I were theConsul... if I were one of the few thousand individuals in the entiredamn Web to own a singleship . . . I'd be damn sure I could fly it inon remote if I needed it. The planet's too primitive to depend on itscomm net, the ionosphere's too weak for shortwave, the comsats are thefirst things to go in a skirmish... I'd call it by fatline."'And the size?" said the Consul.Brawne Lamia returned the diplomat's level gaze.'The Hegemony can't yet build portable fatline transmitters.There are rumors that the Ousters can."The Consul smiled. From somewhere there came a scrape and then thesound of metal crashing.'Stay here,' said Kassad. He removed a deathwand from his tunic,canceled the tripbeams with his tactical comlog, and descended fromsight.'I guess we're under martial law now,' said Silenuswhen the Colonel was gone. 'Mars ascendant."'Shut up,' said Lamia.'Do you think it's the Shrike?" asked Hoyt.The Consul made a gesture. 'The Shrike doesn't have to clank arounddownstairs. It can simply appear...here."Hoyt shook his head. 'I mean the Shrike that has been the cause ofeveryone's... absence. The signs of slaughter here in the Keep."'The empty villages might be the result of the evacuation order,' saidthe Consul. 'No one wants to stay behind to face the Ousters. The SDFforces have been running wild. Much of the carnage could be theirdoing."'With no bodies?" laughed Martin Silenus. 'Wishful thinking. Ourabsent hosts downstairs dangle now on theShrike's steel tree. Where, ere long, we too will be." 'Shut up,'Brawne Lamia said tiredly.'And if I don't,' grinned the poet, 'will you shoot me,madam?"'Yes."The silence lasted until Colonel Kassad returned. He reactivated thetripbeams and turned to the group seated on packing crates and flowfoamcubes. 'It was nothing.Some carrion birds - harbingers, I think the locals call them - had comein through the broken glass doors in the dining hall and were finishingthe feast."Silenus chuckled. 'Harbingers. Very appropriate." Kassad sighed, saton a blanket with his back to a crate, and poked at his cold food. Asingle lantern brought from the windwagon lighted the room and theshadows were beginning to mount the walls in the corners away from thedoor to the balcony. 'It's our lastnight,' said Kassad. 'One more story to tell." He looked at the Consul.The Consul had been twisting his slip of paper with the number 7scrawled on it. He licked his lips. 'What's the purpose? The purposeof the pilgrimage has been destroyed already."The others stirred.'What do you mean?" asked Father Hoyt.The Consul crumpled the paper and threw it into a corner. 'For theShrike to grant a request, the band of pilgrims must constitute a primenumber. We had seven.Masteen's ... disappearance ... reduces us to six.We go to our deaths now with no hope of a wish being granted."'Superstition,' said Lamia.The Consul sighed and rubbed his brow. 'Yes. But that is our finalhope."Father Hoyt gestured toward the sleeping infant.'Can't Rachel be our seventh?"Sol Weintraub rubbed his beard. 'No. A pilgrim must come to the Tombsof his or her own free will."'But she did once,' said Hoyt. 'Maybe it qualifies." 'No,' said theConsul.Martin Silenus had been writing notes on a pad but now he stood andpaced the length of the room. 'Jesus Christ, people. Look at us. We'renot six fucking pilgrims, we're a mob. Hoyt there with his cruciformcarrying the ghost of Paul Dur6. Our "semisentient" erg in the boxthere. Colonel Kassad with his memory of Moneta. M. Brawne there, ifwe are to believe her tale, carrying not only an unborn child but a deadRomantic poet. Our scholar with the child his daughter used to be.Me with my muse. The Consul with whatever fucking baggage he's broughtto this insane trek. My God, people, we should have received a fuckinggroup rate for this trip."'Sit down,' said Lamia in a dead even tone.'No, he's right,' said Hoyt. 'Even the presence of Father Dur6 incruciform must affect the prime-number superstition somehow. I say thatwe press on in the morning in the belief that..."'Look!" cried Brawne Lamia, pointing to the balcony doorway where thefading twilight had been replaced with pulses of strong light.The group went out into the cool evening air, shielding their eyes fromthe staggering display of silent explosions which filled the sky: purewhite fusion bursts expanding like explosive ripples across a lapispond; smaller, brighter plasma implosions in blue and yellow andbrightest red, curling inward like flowers folding for the night: thelightning dance of gigantic heliwhip displays, beams the size of smallworlds cutting their swath across light-hours and being contorted by theriptides of defensive singularities: the aurora shimmer of defensefields leaping and dying under the assault of terrible energies only tobe reborn nanoseconds later. Amid it all, the blue-white fusion tailsof torchships and larger warships slicing perfectly true lines acrossthe sky like diamond scratches on blue glass.'The Ousters,' breathed Brawne Lamia.'The war's begun,' said Kassad. There was no elation in his voice, noemotion of any kind.The Consul was shocked to discover that he was weeping silently. Heturned his face from the group.'Are we in danger here?" asked Martin Silenus. He sheltered under thestone'archway of the door, squinting at the brilliant display.'Not at this distance,' said Kassad. He raised his combat binoculars,made an adjustment, and consulted his tactical tomlog. 'Most of theengagements are at least three AU away. The Ousters are testing theFORCE:space defenses." He lowered the glasses. 'It's just begun."'Has the farcaster been activated yet?" asked Brawne Lamia. 'Are thepeople being evacuated from Keats and the other cities?"Kassad shook his head. 'I don't believe so. Not yet.The fleet will be fighting a holding action until the cislunar sphere iscompleted. Then the evacuation portals will be opened to the Web whileFORCE units come through by the hundreds." He raised the binocularsagain. 'It'll be a hell of a show."'Look!" It was Father Hoyt pointing this time, not at the fireworksdisplay in the sky but out across the low dunes of the northern moors.Several kilometers toward the unseen Tombs, a single figure was justvisible as a speck of a form throwing multiple shadows under thefractured sky.Kassad trained his glasses on the figure.'The Shrike?" asked Lamia.'No, I don't think so... I think it's... a Templar by the looks of therobe."'Het Masteen!" cried Father Hoyt.Kassad shrugged and handed the glasses around. The Consul walked backto the group and leaned on the balcony.There was no sound but the whisper of wind, but that made the violenceof explosions above them more ominous somehow.The Consul took his turn looking when the glasses came to him. Thefigure was tall and robed, its back to the Keep, and strode across theflashing vermilion sands with purposeful intent.'Is he headed toward us or the Tombs?" asked Lamia.'The Tombs,' said the Consul.Father Hoyt leaned elbows on the ledge and raised his gaunt face to theexploding sky. 'If it is Masteen, then we're back to seven, aren't we?"'He'll arrive hours before us,' said the Consul. 'Half a day if wesleep here tonight as we proposed."Hoyt shrugged. 'That can't matter too much. Seven set out on thepilgrimage. Seven will arrive. The Shrike will be satisfied."'If it/s Masteen,' said Colonel Kassad, 'why the charade on thewindwagon? And how did he get here before us? There were no othertramcars running and he couldn't have walked over the Bridle Rangepasses."'We'll ask him when we arrive at the Tombs tomorrow,' Father Hoyt saidtiredly.Brawne Lamia had been trying to raise someone on her comlog's generalcomm frequencies. Nothing emerged but the hiss of static and theoccasional growl of distant EMPs. She looked at Colonel Kassad. 'Whendo they start bombing?"'1 don't know. It depends uporr the strength of the FORCE fleetdefenses."'The defenses weren't very good the other day when the Ouster scouts gotthrough and destroyed theYggdrasi!i,' said Lamia.Kassad nodded.'Hey,' said Martin Silenus, 'are we sitting on a fucking target?"'Of course,' said the Consul. 'If the Ousters are attacking Hyperion toprevent the opening of the Time Tombs, as M. Lamia's tale suggests,then the Tombs and this entire area would be a primary target."'For nukes?" asked Silenus, his voice strained.'Almost certainly,' answered Kassad.'1 thought something about the anti-entropic fields kept ships away fromhere,' said Father Hoyt.'Crewed ships,' said the Consul without looking back at the others fromwhere he leaned on the railing. 'The anti-entropic fields won't botherguided missiles, smart bombs, or hellwhip beams. It won't bother mechinfantry, for that matter. The Ousters could land a few attack skimmersor automated tanks and watch on remote while they destroy the valley."'But they won't,' said Brawne Lamia. 'They want to control Hyperion,not destroy it."'I wouldn't wager my life on that supposition,' said Kassad.Lamia smiled at him, 'But we are, aren't we, Colonel?"Above them, a single spark separated itself from the continuouspatchwork of explosions, grew into a bright orange ember, and streakedacross the sky. The group on the terrace could see the flames, hear thetortured shriek of atmospheric penetration. The fireball disappearedbeyond the mountains behind the Keep.Almost a minute later, the Consul realized that he had been holding hisbreath, his hands rigid on the stone railing. He let out air in a gasp.The others seemed to be taking a breath at the same moment. There hadbeen no explosion, no shock wave rumbling through the rock.'A dud?" asked Father Hoyt.'Probably an injured FORCE skirmisher trying to reach the orbitalperimeter or the spaceport at Keats,' said Colonel Kassad.'He didn't make it, did he?" asked Lamia. Kassad did not respond.Martin Silenus lifted the field glasses and searched the darkening moorsfor the Templar. 'Out of sight,' said Silenus. 'The good Captaineither rounded that hill just this side of the Time Tombs valley or hepulled his disappearing act again."'It's a pity that we'll never hear his story,' said Father Hoyt. Heturned toward the Consul. 'But we'll hear yours, won't we?"The Consul rubbed his palms against his pant legs. His heart wasracing. 'Yes,' he said, realizing even as he spoke that he had finallymade up his mind. 'I'11 tell mine."The wind roared down the east slopes of the mountains and whistled alongthe escarpment of Chronos Keep. The explosions above them seemed tohave diminished ever so slightly, but the coming of darkness made eachone look even more violent than the last.'Let's go inside,' said Lamia, her words almost lost in the wind sound.'It's getting cold."They had turned off the single lamp and the interior of the room waslighted only by the heat-lightning pulses of color from the sky outside.Shadows sprang into being, vanished, and appeared again as the room waspainted in many colors. Sometimes the darkness would last severalseconds before the next barrage.The Consul reached into his traveling bag and took out a strange device,larger than a comlog, oddly orna-mented, and fronted with a liquidcrystal diskey like something out of a history holo.'Secret fatline transmitter?" Brawne Lamia asked dryly.The Consul's smile showed no humor. 'It's an ancient comlog. It cameout during the Hegira." He removed a standard micro-disk from a pouch onhis belt and inserted it. 'Like Father Hoyt, I have someone else's taleto tell before you can understand my own."'Christ on a stick,' sneered Martin Silenus, 'am I the only one who cantell a straightforward story in this fucking herd? How long do I haveto..."The Consui's movement surprised even himself. He rose, spun, caught thesmaller man by the cape and shirt-front, slammed him against the wail,draped him over a packing crate with a knee in Silenus's belly and aforearm against his throat, and hissed, 'One more word from you, poet,and I'll kill you."Silenus began to struggle but a tightening on his windpipe and a glanceat the Consul's eyes made him cease.His face was very white.Colonel Kassad silently, almost gently, separated the two. 'There willbe no more comments,' he said. He touched the deathwand in his belt.Martin Silenus went to the far side of the circle, still rubbing histhroat, and slumped against a crate without a word. The Consul strodeto the door, took several deep breaths, and walked back to the group. Hespoke to everyone but the poet. 'l'm sorry. It is just that . . . Inever expected to share this."The light from outside surged red and then white, followed by a blueglow which faded to near darkness.'We know,' Brawne Lamia said softly. 'We all felt that way."The Consul touched his lower lip, nodded, roughly cleared his throat,and came to sit by the ancient comlog.'The recording is not as old as the instrument,' he said.'It was made about fifty standard years ago. I'll have some more to saywhen it's over." He paused as if there were more to be said, shook hishead, and thumbed the antique diskey.There were no visuals. The voice was that of a young man. In thebackground one could hear a breeze blowing through grass or softbranches and, more distantly, the roll of surf.Outside, the light pulsed madly as the tempo of the distant space battlequickened. The Consul tensed as he waited for the crash and concussion.There was none. He closed his eyes and listened with the others.THE CONSUL'S TALE: Remembering SiriI climb the steep hill to Siri's tomb on the day the islands return tothe shallow seas of the Equatorial Archipelago.The day is perfect and I hate it for being so. The sky is as tranquilas tales of Old Earth's seas, the shallows are dappled with ultramarinetints, and a warm breeze blows in from the sea to ripple the russetwillowgrass on the hillside near me.Better low clouds and gray gloom on such a day. Better mist or ashrouding fog which sets the masts in First-site Harbor dripping andraises the lighthouse horn from its slumbers. Better one of the greatsea-simoons blowing up out of the cold belly of the south, lashingbefore it the motile isles and their dolphin herders until they seekrefuge in the lee of our atolls and stony peaks.Anything would be better than this warm spring day when the sun movesthrough a vault of sky so blue that it makes me want to run, to jump ingreat loping arcs, and to roll in the soft grass as Siri and I have doneat just this spot.Just this spot. I pause to look around. The willowgrass bends andripples like the fur of some great beast as the salt-tinged breeze gustsup out of the south. I shield my eyes and search the horizon butnothing moves there.Out beyond the lava reef, the sea begins to chop and lift itself innervous strokes.'Siri,' I whisper. I say her name without meaning to do so. A hundredmeters down the slope, the crowd pauses to watch me and to catch itscollective breath. The procession of mourners and celebrants stretchesfor more than a kilometer to where the white buildings of the citybegin. I can make out the gray and balding head of my younger son inthe vanguard. He is wearing the blue and gold robes of the Hegemony. Iknow that I should wait for him, walk with him, but he and the otheraging Council members cannot keep up with my young, ship-trained musclesand steady stride. But decorum dictates that I should walk with him andmy granddaughter Lira and my nine-year-old grandson.To hell with it. And to hell with them.I turn and jog up the steep hillside. Sweat begins to soak my loosecotton shirt before I reach the curvingsummit of the ridge and catch sight of the tomb.Siri' s tomb.I stop. The wind chills me although the sunlight is warm enough as itglints off the flawless white stone of the silent mausoleum. The grassis high near the sealed entrance to the crypt. Rows of faded festivalpennants on ebony staffs line the narrow gravel path.Hesitating, I circle the tomb and approach the steep cliff edge a fewmeters beyond. The willowgrass is bent and trampled here whereirreverent picnickers have laid their blankets. There are several firerings formed from the perfectly round, perfectly white stones purloinedfrom the border of the gravel path.I cannot stop a smile. I know the view from here: the great curve ofthe outer harbor with its natural seawall, the low, white buildings ofFirstsite, and the colorful hulls and masts of the catamarans bobbing atanchorage.Near the pebble beach beyond Common Hall, a young woman in a white skirtmoves toward the water. For a second I think that it is Siri and myheart pounds. 1 half prepare to throw up my arms in response to herwave but she does not wave. I watch in silence as the distant figureturns away and is lost in the shadows of the old boat building.Above me, far out from the cliff, a wide-winged Thomas Hawk circlesabove the lagoon on rising thermals and scans the shifting bluekelp bedswith its infrared vision, seeking out harp seals or torpids. Nature hvstupid, I think and sit in the soft grass. Nature sets the stage allwrong for such a day and then it is insensitive enough to throw in abird searching for prey which have long since fled the polluted watersnear the growing city.I remember another Thomas Hawk on that first night when Siri and I cameto this hilltop. I remember the moonlight on its wings and the strange,haunting crywhich echoed off the cliff and seemed to pierce the dark air above thegaslights of the village below.Siri was sixteen... no, not quite sixteen... and the moonlight thattouched the hawk's wings above us also painted her bare skin with milkylight and cast shadows beneath the soft circles of her breasts. Welooked up guiltily when the bird's cry cut the night and Siri said, '"It was the nightingale and not the lark, That pierc'd the fearfulhollow of thine ear." ''Huh?" I said. Siri was almost sixteen. I was nineteen.But Siri knew the slow pace of books and the cadences of theater underthe stars. I knew only the stars.'Relax, young Shipman,' she whispered and pulled me down beside herthen. 'It's only an old Tom's Hawk hunting. Stupid bird. Come back,Shipman. Come back, Merin."The Los Angeles had chosen that moment to rise above the horizon and tofloat like a wind-borne ember west across the strange constellations ofMaui-Covenant, Siri's world. I lay next to her and described theworkings of the great Hawking-drive spinship which was catching the highsunlight against the drop of night above us, and all the while my handwas sliding lower along her smooth side, her skin seemed all velvet andelectricity, and her breath came more quickly against my shoulder. Ilowered my face to the hollow of her neck, to the sweat and perfumeessence of her tousled hair.'Siri,' I say and this time her name is not unbidden.Below me, below the crest of the hill and the shadow of the white tomb,the crowd stands and shuffles. They are impatient with me. They wantme to unseal the tomb, to enter, and to have my private moment in thecool silent emptiness that has replaced the warm presence that was Siri.They want me to say my farewells so they can get on with their rites andrituals, open the farcaster doors, andjoin the waiting Worldweb of the Hegemony.To hell with that. And to hell with them.I pull up a tendril of the thickly woven willowgrass, chew on the sweetstem, and watch the horizon for the first sign of the migrating islands.The shadows are stilllong in the morning light. The day is young. I will sit here for awhile and remember.I will remember Siri.Siri was a... what?... a bird, I think, the first time 1 saw her. Shewas wearing some sort of mask with bright feathers. When she removed itto join in the raceme quadrille, the torchlight caught the deep auburntints of her hair. She was flushed, cheeks aflame, and even from acrossthe crowded common I could see the startling green of her eyescontrasting with the summer heat of her face and hair. It was FestivalNight, of course. The torches danced and sparked to the stiff breezecoming in off the harbor and the sound of the flutists on the break-wallplaying for the passing isles was almost drowned out by surf sounds andthe crack of pennants snapping in the wind. Siri was almost sixteen andher beauty burned more brightly than any of the torches set round thethrong-filled square. I pushed through the dancing crowd and went toher.It was five years ago for me. It was more than sixty five years ago forus. It seems only yesterday.This is not going well.Where to start?'What say we go find a little nooky, kid?" Mike Osho was speaking.Short, squat, his pudgy face a clever caricature of a Buddha, Mike was agod to me then. We were all gods; long-lived if not immortal, well paidif not quite divine. The Hegemony had chosen us to help crew one of itsprecious quantum-leap spinships, so how could we be less than gods? Itwas just that Mike, brilliant, mercurial, irreverent Mike, was a littleolder and a little higher in the Shipboard pantheon than young MerinAspic.'Hah. Zero probability of that,' I said. We were scrubbing up after atwelve-hour shift with the farcaster construction crew. Shuttling theworkers around their chosen singularity point some one hundred andsixty-three thousand kilometers out from Maul-Covenant was a lot lessglamorous for us than the four-month leap from Hegemony-space. Duringthe C-plus portion of thetrip we had been master specialists; forty-nine starship expertsshepherding some two hundred nervous passengers.Now the passengers had their hardsuits on and we Shipmen had beenreduced to serving as glorified truck drivers as the construction crewwrestled the bulky singularity containment sphere into place.'Zero probability,' I repeated. 'Unless the groundlings have added awhorehouse to that quarantine island they leased us."'Nope. They haven't,' grinned Mike. He and I had our three days ofplanetary R and R coming up but we knew from Shipmaster Singh'sbriefings and the moans of our Shipmates that the only ground time wehad to look forward to would be spent on a seven-by-four-kilometerisland administered by the Hegemony. It wasn't even one of the motileisles we had heard about, just another volcanic peak near the equator.Once there, we could i:ount on real gravity underfoot, unfiltered air tobreathe, and the chance to taste unsynthesized food. But we could alsocount on the fact that the only intercourse we would have with theMaul-Covenant colonists would be through buying local artifacts at theduty-free store.Even those were sold by Hegemony trade specialists.Many of our Shipmates had chosen to spend their R and R on the LosAngeles.'So how do we find a little nooky, Mike? The colonies are off limitsuntil the farcaster's working. That's about sixty years away, localtime. Or are you talking about Meg in spincomp?"'Stick with me, kid,' said Mike. 'Where there's a will, there's a way."I stuck with Mike. There were only five of us in the dropship. It wasalways a thrill to me to fall out of high orbit into the atmosphere of areal world. Especially a world that looked as much like Old Earth asMaul-Covenant did. I stared at the blue and white limb of the planetuntil the seas were down and we were in atmosphere, approaching thetwilight terminator in a gentle glide at three times the speed of ourown sound.We were gods then. But even gods must descend from their high thronesupon occasion.AAASiri's body never ceased to amaze me. That time on the Archipelago.Three weeks in that huge, swaying tree-house under the billowingtreesails with the dolphin herders keeping pace like outriders, tropicalsunsets filling the evening with wonder, the canopy of stars at night,and our own wake marked by a thousand phosphorescent swirls thatmirrored the constellations above. And still it is Siri's body Iremember. For some reason-shyness, the years of separation - she woretwo strips of swimsuit for the first few days of our Archipelago stayand the soft white of her breasts and lower belly had not darkened tomatch the rest of her tan before I had to leave again.I remember her that first time. Triangles in the moonlight as we lay inthe soft grass above Firstsite Harbor.Her silk pants catching on a weave of willowgrass. There was a child'smodesty then; the slight hesitation of something given prematurely. Butalso pride. The same pride that later allowed her to face down theangry mob of Separatists on the steps of the Hegemony consulate in SouthTern and send them to their homes in shame.I remember my fifth planetfall, our Fourth Reunion.It was one of the few times I ever saw her cry. She was almost regal inher fame and wisdom by then. She had been elected four times to the AllThing and the Hegemony Council turned to her for advice and guidance.She wore her independence like a royal cloak and her fierce pride hadnever burned more brightly. But when we were alone in the stone villasouth of Fevarone, it was she who turned away. I was nervous,frightened by this powerful stranger, but it was $iri- Siri of thestraight back and proud eyes, who turned her face to the wall and saidthrough tears, 'Go away. Go away, Merin.I don't want you to see me. I'm a crone, all slack and sagging. Goaway."I confess that I was rough with her then. I pinned her wrists with myleft hand - using a strength which surprised even me - and tore hersilken robe down the front in one move. I kissed her shoulders, herneck, the faded shadows of stretch marks on her taut belly, and the scaron her upper leg from the skimmer crash some forty of her years earlier.I kissed her graying hair and the lines etched in the once smoothcheeks. I kissed her tears.'Jesus, Mike, this can't be legal,' I'd said when my friend unrolled thehawking mat from his backpack. We were on island 241, as the Hegemonytraders had so romantically named the desolate volcanic blemish whichthey had chosen for our R and R site. Island 241 was less than fiftykilometers from the oldest of the colonial settlements but it might aswell have been fifty light-years away. No native ships were to put inat the island while Los Angeles crewmen or farcaster workmen werepresent.The Maul-Covenant colonists had a few ancient skimmers still in workingorder, but by mutual agreement there would be no overflights. Exceptfor the dormitories, swimming beach, and the duty-free store, there waslittle on the island to interest us Shipmen.Someday, when the last components had been brought in-system by the LosAngeles and the farcaster finished, Hegemony officials would make island241 into a center for trade and tourism. Until then it was a primitiveplace with a dropship grid, newly finished buildings of the local whitestone, and a few bored maintenance people.Mike checked the two of us out for three days of backpacking on thesteepest and most inaccessible end of the little island.'I don't want to go backpacking, for Chrissake,' I'd said. 'I'd ratherstay on the L.A. and plug into a stimsim."'Shut up and follow me,' said Mike and, like a lesser member of thepantheon following an older and wiser deity, I had shut up and followed.Two hours of heavy tramping up the slopes through sharp-branchedscrubtrees brought us to a lip of lava several hundred meters above thecrashing surf. We were near the equator on a mostly tropical world buton this exposed ledge the wind was howling and my teeth were chattering.The sunset was a red smear between dark cumulus to the west and ! hadno wish to be out in the open when full night descended.'Come on,' I said. 'Let's get out of the wind and build a fire. Idon't know how the hell we're going to set up a tent on all of thisrock."Mike sat down and lit a cannabis stick. 'Take a look in your pack,kid."I hesitated. His voice had been neutral but it was the flat neutralityof the practical joker's voice just before the bucket of water descends.I crouched down and began pawing through the nylon sack. The pack wasempty except for old flowfoam packing cubes to fill it out. Those and aHarlequin's costume complete with mask and bells on the toes.'Are you... is this... are you goddamn crazy?" I spluttered. It wasgetting dark quickly now. The storm might or might not pass to thesouth of us. The surf was rasping below like a hungry beast. If I hadknown how to find my own way back to .the trade compound in the dark, Imight have considered leaving Mike Osho's remains to feed the fishes farbelow.'Now look at what's in my pack,' he said. Mike dumped out some flowfoamcubes and then removed some jewelry of the type I'd seen handcrafted onRenaissance Vector, an inertial compass, a laser pen which might ormight not be labeled a concealed weapon by ShipSecurity, anotherHarlequin costume - this one tailored to his more rotund form ' and ahawking mat.'Jesus, Mike,' I said while running my hand over the exquisite design ofthe old carpet, 'this can't be legal."'I didn't notice any customs agents back there,' grinned Mike. 'And Iseriously doubt that the locals have any traffic control ordinances."'Yes, but..." I trailed off and unrolled the rest of the mat. It was alittle more than a meter wide and about two meters long. The richfabric had faded with age but the flight threads were still as bright asnew copper. 'Where did you get it?" I asked. 'Does it still work?"'On Garden,' said Mike and stuffed my costume and his other gear intohis backpack. 'Yes, it does."It had been more than a century since old Vladimir Sholokov, Old Earthemigrant, master lepidopterist, and EM systems engineer, had handcraftedthe firsthawking mat for his beautiful young niece on New Earth. Legend had itthat the niece had scorned the gift but over the decades the toys hadbecome almost absurdly popular - more with rich adults than withchildrenuntil they were outlawed on most Hegemony worlds. Dangerous tohandle, a waste of shielded monofilaments, almost impossible to dealwith in controlled airspace, hawking mats had become curiositiesreserved for bedtime stories, museums, and a few colony worlds.'It must have cost you a fortune,' I said.'Thirty marks,' said Mike and settled himself on the center of thecarpet. 'The old dealer in Carvnel Marketplace thought it wasworthless. It was . . . for him. 1 brought it back to the ship,charged it up, reprogrammed the inertia chips, and voild!" Mike palmedthe intricate design and the mat stiffened and rose fifteen centimetersabove the rock ledge.I stared doubtfully. 'All right,' I said, 'but what if it..."'It won't,' said Mike and impatiently patted the carpet behind him.'It's fully charged. I know how to handle it.Come on, climb on or stand back. I want to get goingbefore that storm gets any closer."'But I don't think..."'Come on, Merin. Make up your mind. I'm in a hurry."I hesitated for another second or two. If we were caught leaving theisland, we would both be kicked off the ship. Shipwork was my life now.I had made that decision when I accepted the eight-mission Maui-Covenantcontract. More than that, I was two hundred light-years and five and ahalf leap years from civilization.Even if they brought us back to Hegemony-space, the round trip wouldhave cost us eleven years' worth of friends and family. The time-debtwas irrevocable.I crawled on the hovering hawking mat behind Mike.He stuffed the backpack between us, told me to hang on, and tapped atthe flight designs. The mat rose five meters above the ledge, bankedquickly to the left, and shot out over the alien ocean. Three hundredmeters below us, thesurf crashed whitely in the deepening gloom. We rose higher above therough water and headed north into the night.In such seconds of decision entire futures arc made.I remember talking to Siri during our Second Reunion, shortly after wefirst visited the villa along the coast near Fevarone. We were walkingalong the beach. A16n had been allowed to stay in the city underMagritte's supervision.It was just as well. I was not truly comfortable with the boy. Onlythe undeniable green solemnity of his eyes and the disturbingmirror-familiarity of his short, dark curls and snub of a nose served totie him to me... to us . . . in my mind. That and the quick, almostsardonic smile I would catch him hiding from Siri when she reprimandedhim. It was a smile too cynically amused and self-observant to be sopracticed in a ten-year-old. I knew it well. I would have thought suchthings were learned, not inherited.'You know very little,' Siri said to me. She was wading, shoeless, in ashallow tidepool. From time to time she would lift the delicate shellof a frenchhorn conch, inspect it for flaws, and drop it back into thesilty water.Tve been well trained,' I replied.'Yes, I'm sure you've been well trained,' agreed Siri. 'I know you arequite skillful, Merin. But you know very little."Irritated, unsure of how to respond, I walked along with my headlowered. I dug a white lavastone out of the sand and tossed it far outinto the bay. Rain clouds were piling along the eastern horizon. Ifound myself wishing that I was back aboard the ship. I had beenreluctant to return this time and now I knew that it had been a mistake.It was my third visit to Maui-Covenant, our Second Reunion as the poetsand her people were calling it. I was five months away from beingtwenty-one standard years old. Siri had just celebrated herthirty-seventh birthday three weeks earlier.'I've been to a lot of places you've never seen,' I said at last. Itsounded petulant and childish even to me.'Oh, yes,' said Siri and clapped her hands together.For a second, in her enthusiasm, I glimpsed my other Siri -the younggirl I had dreamed about during the long nine.months of turnaround. Thenthe image slid back to harsh reality and I was all too aware of hershort hair, the loosening neck muscles, and the cords appearing on thebacks of those once beloved hands.'You've been to places I'll never see,' said Siri in a rush.Her voice was the same. Almost the same. 'Merin, my love, you'vealready seen things I cannot even imagine.You probably know more facts about the universe than I would guessexist. But you know very little, my darling."'What the hell are you talking about, Siri?" I sat down on ahalf-submerged log near the strip of wet sand and drew my knees up likea fence between us.Siri strode out of the tidepool and came to kneel in front of me. Shetook my hands in hers and, although mine were bigger, heavier, bluntcrof finger and bone, I could feel the strength in hers. I imagined it asthe strength of years I had not shared. 'You have to live to reallyknow things, my love. Having A16n has helped me to understand that.There is something about raising achild that helps to sharpen one's sense of what is real." 'How do youmean?"Siri squinted away from me for a few seconds and absently brushed back astrand of hair. Her left hand stayed firmly around both of mine. 'I'mnot sure,' she said softly. 'I think one begins to feel when thingsaren't important. I'm not sure how to put it. When you've spent thirtyyears entering rooms filled with strangers you feel less pressure thanwhen you've had only half that number of years of experience. You knowwhat the room and the people in it probably hold for you and you golooking for it. If it's not there, you sense it earlier and leave to goabout your business. You just know more about what is, what isn't, andhow little time there is to learn the difference. Do you understand,Merin? Do youfollow me even a little bit?"'No,' I said.Siri nodded and bit her lower lip. But she did not speak again for awhile. Instead, she leaned over and kissed me.Her lips were dry and a little questioning. I held back for a second,seeing the sky beyond her, wanting time to think. But then I felt thewarm intrusion of her tongue and closed my eyes. The tide was coming inbehind us. I felt a sympathetic warmth and rising as Siri unbuttoned myshirt and ran sharp fingernails across my chest. There was a second ofemptiness between us and I opened my eyes in time to see her unfasteningthe last buttons on the front of her white dress. Her breasts werelarger than 1 remembered, heavier, the nipples broader and darker.The chill air nipped at both of us until I pulled the fabric down hershoulders and brought our upper bodies together. We slid down along thelog to the warm sand. I pressed her closer, all the While wondering howI possibly could have thought her the stronger one. Her skin tasted ofsalt.Siri's hands helped me. Her short hair pressed back against bleachedwood, white cotton, and sand. My pulse outraced the surf.'Do you understand, Merin?" she whispered to me seconds later as herwarmth connected us.'Yes,' I whispered back. But I did not.Mike brought the hawking mat in from the east toward Firstsite. Theflight had taken over an hour in the dark and I had spent most of thetime huddling from the wind and waiting for the carpet to fold up andtumble us both into the sea. We were still half an hour out when we sawthe first of the motile isles. Racing before the storm, treesailsbillowing, the islands sailed up from their southern feeding grounds inseemingly endless procession.Many were !it brilliantly, festooned with coloredlanterns and shifting veils of gossamer light.'You sure this is the way?" I shouted.'Yes,' shouted Mike. He did not turn his head. The wind whipped hislong black hair back against my face.From time to time he would check his compass and make small correctionsto our course. It might have been easier to follow the isles. Wepassed one - a large one almost half a kilometer in length - and Istrained to make out details but the isle was dark except for the glowof itsphosphorescent wake. Dark shapes cut through the milky waves. I tappedMike on the shoulder and pointed.'Dolphins!" he shouted. 'That's what this colony was all about,remember? A bunch of do-gooders during the Hegira wanted to save allthe mammals in Old Earth's oceans. Didn't succeed."I would have shouted another question but at that moment the headlandand Firstsite Harbor came into view.I had thought the stars were bright above Maui-Covenant.I had thought the migrating islands were memorable in their colorfuldisplay. But the city of First-site, wrapped about with harbor andhills, was a blazing beacon in the night. Its brilliance reminded me ofa torchship I once had watched while it created its own plasma novaagainst the dark limb of a sullen gas giant..The city was a five-tiered honeycomb of white buildings, all illuminatedby warmly glowing lanterns from within and by countless torches fromwithout. The white lava-stone of the volcanic island itself seemed toglow from the city light. Beyond the town were tents, pavilions,campfires, cooking fires, and great flaming pyres, too large forfunction, too large for anything except to serve as a welcome to thereturning isles.The harbor was filled with boats: bobbing catamarans with cow-bellsclanking from their masts, large-hulled, flat-bottomed house-boats builtfor creeping from port to port in the calm equatorial shallows butproudly ablaze with strings of lights this night, and then theoccasional oceangoing yacht, sleek and functional as a shark.A lighthouse set out on the pincer's end of the harbor reef threw itsbeam far out to sea, illuminated wave and isle alike, and then swept itslight back in to catch the colorful bobbing of ships and men.Even from two kilometers out we could hear the noise.Sounds of celebration were clearly audible. Above the shouts andconstant susurration of the surf rose the unmistakable notes of a Bachflute sonata. I learned later that this welcoming chorus wastransmitted through hydrophones to the Passage Channels where dolphinsleaped and cavorted to the music.'My God, Mike, how did you know all of this was going on?"' 1 asked the main ship computer,' said Mike. The hawking mat bankedright to keep us far out from the ships and lighthouse beam. Then wecurved back in north of Firstsite toward a dark spit o fland. I couldhear the soft booming of waves on the shallows ahead. 'They have thisfestival every year,' Mike went on, 'but this is their sesquicentennial.The party's been going on for three weeks now and is scheduled tocontinue another two. There are only about a hundred thousand colonistson this whole world, Merin, and I bet half of them are here partying."We slowed, came in carefully, and touched down on a rocky outcroppingnot far from the beach. The storm had missed us to the south butintermittent flashes of lightning and the distant lights of advancingisles still marked the horizon. Overhead, the stars were not dimmed bythe glow from Firstsite just over the rise from us. The air was warmerhere and I caught the scent of orchards on the breeze. We folded up thehawking mat and hurried to get into our Harlequin costumes. Mikeslipped his laser pen and jewelry into loose pockets.'What are those for?" I asked as we secured the backpack and hawking matunder a large boulder.'These?" asked Mike as he dangled a Renaissance necklace from hisfingers. 'These are currency in case we have tonegotiate for favors."'Favors?"'Favors,' repeated Mike. 'A lady's largesse. Comfort to a wearyspacefarer. Nooky to you, kid."'Oh,' I said and adjusted my mask and fool's cap. The bells made a softsound in the dark.'Come on,' said Mike. 'We'll miss the party." I nodded and followedhim, bells jangling, as we picked our way over stone and scrub towardthe waiting light.I sit here in the sunlight and wait. I am not totally certain what I amwaiting for. I can feel a growing warmth on my back as the morningsunlight is reflected from the white stone of Siri's tomb.Siri's tomb?There are no clouds in the sky. I raise my head and squint skyward asif I might be able to see the L.A. and the newly finished farcasterarray through the glare of atmosphere. I cannot. Part of me knows thatthey have not risen yet. Part of me knows to the second the timeremaining before ship and farcaster complete their transit to thezenith. Part of me does not want to thinkabout it.Siri, am I doing the right thing?There is the sudden sound of pennants stirring on their staffs as thewind comes up. I sense rather than see the restlessness of the waitingcrowd. For the first time since my planetfall for this, our SeventhReunion, I am filled with sorrow. No, not sorrow, not yet, but asharp-toothed sadness which soon will open into grief. For years I havecarried on silent conversations with Siri, framing questions to myselffor future discussion with her, and it suddenly strikes me with coldclarity that we will never again sit together and talk. An emptinessbegins to grow inside me. Should I let it happen, Siri?There is no response except for the growing murmurs of the crowd. In afew minutes-they will send Donel, my younger and surviving son, or hisdaughter Lira and her brother up the hill to urge me on. I toss awaythe sprig of willowgrass I've been chewing on. There is a hint ofshadow on the horizon. It could be a cloud. Or it could be the firstof the isles, driven by instinct and the spring northerlies to migrateback to the great band of the equa torial shallows whence they came. Itdoes not matter.Siri, am I doing the right thing?There is no answer and the time grows shorter.Sometimes Siri seemed so ignorant it made me sick.She knew nothing of my life away from her. She would ask questions butI sometimes wondered if she was interested in the answers. I spent manyhours explaining the beautiful physics behind our spinships but shenever did seem to understand. Once, after I had taken great care todetail the differences between their ancient seedship and the LosAngeles, Siri astounded me by asking, 'But whydid it take my ancestors eighty years of shiptime to reach Maul-Covenantwhen you can make the trip in a hundred and thirty days?" She hadunderstood nothing.Siri's sense of history was, at best, pitiful. She viewed the Hegemonyand the Worldweb the way a child would view the fantasy world of apleasant but rather silly myth; there was an indifference there thatalmost drove me mad at times.Siri knew all about the early days of the Hegira - at least insofar asthey pertained to the Maui-Covenant and the colonists - and sheoccasionally would come up with delightful bits of archaic trivia orphraseology, but she knew nothing of post-Hegira realities. Names likeGarden and the Ousters, Renaissance and Lusus meant little to her. Icould mention Salmud Brew or General Horace Glennon-Height and she wouldhave no associations or reactions at all. None.The last time I saw Siri she was seventy standard years old. She wasseventy years old and still she had never traveled offworld, used afatline, tasted any alcoholic drink except wine, interfaced with anempathy surgeon, stepped through a farcaster door, smoked a cannahisstick, received gene tailoring, plugged into a stimsim, received anyformal schooling, taken any RNA medication, heard of Zen Gnostics or theShrike Church, or flown any vehicle except an ancient Vikken skimmerbelonging to her family.Siri had never made love to anyone except me. Or so she said. And so Ibelieved. ,It was during our First Reunion, that time on the Archipelago, when Siritook me to talk with the dolphins.We had risen to watch the dawn. The highest levels of the tree-housewere a perfect place from which to watch the eastern sky pale and fadeto morning. Ripples of high cirrus turned to rose and then the seaitself grew molten as the sun floated above the flat horizon.'Let's go swimming,' said Sift. The rich, horizontal light bathed herskin and threw her shadow four meters across the boards of the platform.'I'm too tired,' I said. 'Later." We had lain awakemost of the night talking, making love, talking, and making love again.In the glare of morning I felt empty and vaguely nauseated. I sensedthe slight movement of the isle under me as a tinge of vertigo, adrunkard's disconnection from gravity.'No. Let's go now,' said Siri and grasped my hand to pull me along. Iwas irritated but did not argue. Siri was twenty-six, seven years olderthan I during that First Reunion, but her impulsive behavior oftenreminded me of the teen-aged Siri I had carried away from the Festivalonly ten of my months earlier. Her deep, unselfconious laugh was thesame. Her green eyes cut as sharply when she was impatient. The longmane of auburn hair had not changed. But her body had ripened, filledout with a promise which had been only hinted at before. Her breastswere still high and full, almost girlish, bordered above by frecklesthat gave way to a whiteness so translucent that a gentle blue traceryof veins could be seen. But they were different somehow. She wasdifferent.'Are you going to join me or just sit there staring?" asked Siri. Shehad slipped off her caftan as we came out onto the lowest deck. Oursmall ship was still tied to the dock. Above us, the island's treesailswere beginning to open to the morning breeze. For the past several daysSiri had insisted on wearing swimstrips when we went into the water. Shewore none now. Her nipples rose in the cool air.'Won't we be left behind?" I asked, squinting up at the flappingtreesails. On previous days we had waited for the doldrums in themiddle of the day when the isle was still in the water, the sea a glazedmirror. Now the jibvines were beginning to pull taut as the thickleaves filled with wind.'Don't be silly,' said Siri. 'We could always catch a keel-root andfollow it back. That or a feeding tendril. Come on." She tossed anosmosis mask at me and donned her own. The transparent film made herface look slick with oil. From the pocket of her discarded caftan shelifted a thick medallion and set it in place around her neck. Themetal looked dark and ominous against her skin.'What's that?" I asked.Siri did not lift the osmosis mask to answer. She set thecomthreads in place against her neck and handed me the earplugs. Hervoice was tinny. 'Translation disk,' she said. 'Thought you knew allabout gadgets, Merin. Last one in's a seaslug." She held the disk inplace between her breasts with one hand and stepped off the isle. Icould see the pale globes of her buttocks as she pirouetted and kickedfor depth. In seconds she was only a white blur deep in the water. Islipped my own mask on, pressed the comthreads tight, and stepped intothe sea.The bottom of the isle was a dark stain on a ceiling of crystallinelight. I was wary of the thick feeding tendrils even though Siri hadamply demonstrated that they were interested in devouring nothing largerthan the tiny zooplankton that even now caught the sunlight like dust inan abandoned ballroom. Keeiroots descended like gnarled stalactites forhundreds of meters into the purple depths.The isle was moving. I could see the faint fibrillation of the tendrilsas they trailed along. A wake caught the light ten meters above me. Fora second I was choking, the gel of the mask smothering me as surely asthe surrounding water would, and then I relaxed and the air flowedfreely into my lungs.'Deeper, Merin,' came Siri's voice. I blinked - a slow-motion blink asthe mask readjusted itself over my eyes- and caught sight of Siri twentymeters lower, grasping a keelroot and trailing effortlessly above thecolder, deeper currents where the light did not reach. 1 thought of thethousands of meters of water under me, of the things which might lurkthere, unknown, unsought out by the human colonists. I thought of thedark and the depths and my scrotum tightened involuntarily.'Come on down." Siri's voice was an insect buzz in my ears. I rotatedand kicked. The buoyancy here was not so great as in Old Earth'sseas,but it still took energy to dive so deep. The mask compensated fordepth and nitrogen but I could feel the pressure against my skin andears.Finally i quit kicking, grabbed a keelroot, and roughly hauled myselfdown to Siri's level.We floated side by side in the dim light. Siri was aspectral figure here, her long hair swirling in a wine-dark nimbus, thepale strips of her body glowing in the blue-green light. The surfaceseemed impossibly distant. The widening V of the wake and the drift ofthe scores of tendrils showed that the isle was moving more quickly now,moving mindlessly to other feeding grounds, distant waters.'Where are the..." I began to subvocalize.'Shhh,' said Siri. She fiddled with the medallion. I could hear themthen: the shrieks and trills and whistles and cat purrs and echoingcries. The depths were suddenly filled with strange music.'Jesus,' I said and because Siri had tuned our cornthreads to thetranslator, the word was broadcast as a senseless whistle and toot.'Hello!" she called and the translated greeting echoed from thetransmitter; a high-speed bird's call sliding into the ultrasonic.'Hello!" she called again.Minutes passed before the dolphins came to investigate.They rolled past us, surprisingly large, alarmingly large, their skinlooking slick and muscled in the uncertain light. A large one swamwithin a meter of us, turning at the last moment so that the white ofhis belly curved past us like a wall. I could see the dark eye rotateto follow me as he passed. One stroke of his wide fluke kicked up aturbulence strong enough to convince me of the animal's power.'Hello,' called Siri but the swift form faded into distant haze andthere was a sudden silence. Siri clicked off the translator. 'Do youwant to talk to them?" she asked.'Sure." I was dubious. More than three centuries of effort had notraised much of a dialogue between man and sea mammal. Mike had oncetold me that the thought structures of Old Earth's two groups of orphanswere too different, the referents too few. One pre-Hegira expert hadwritten that speaking to a dolphin or porpoise was about as rewarding asspeaking to a one-year-old human infant. Both sides usually enjoyed theexchange and there was a simulacrum of conversation, but neither partywould come away the more knowledgeable. Siri switched the translatordisk back on. 'Hello,' I said.There was a final minute of silence and then our ear-phones were buzzingwhile the sea echoed shrill ululations.distance/noofiuke/heilo-tone?/current pulse/circle me/funny?'What the hell?" I asked Siri and the translator trilled out myquestion. Siri was grinning under her osmosis mask.I tried again. 'Hello! Greetings from... uh... the surface. How areyou?"The large male . . . I assumed it to be a male . . .curved in toward us like a torpedo. He arch-kicked his way through thewater ten times faster than I could have swum even if I had rememberedto don flippers that morning. For a second I thought he was going toram us and I raised my knees and clung tightly to the keelroot.Then he was past us, climbing for air, while Siri and I reeled from histurbulent wake and the high tones of his shout.no-fiuke/no-feed/no-swim/no-play/no-fun.Siri switched off the translator and floated closer. She lightlygrasped my shoulders while I held on to the keel-root with my righthand. Our legs touched as we drifted through the warm water. A schoolof tiny crimson warriorfish flickered above us while the dark shapes ofthe dolphins circled farther out.'Had enough?" she asked. Her hand was flat on my chest.'One more try,' I said. Siri nodded and twisted the disk to life. Thecurrent pushed us together again. She slid her arm around me.'Why do you herd the islands?" I asked the bottle-nosed shapes circlingin the dappled light. 'How does it benefit you to stay with the isles?"sounding now/old songs/deep water/no-Great Voices/no-Shark/old songs/newsongs.Siri's body lay along the length of me now. Her left arm tightenedaround me. 'Great Voices were the whales,' she whispered. Her hairfanned out in streamers.Her right hand moved down and seemed surprised at what it found.'Do you miss the Great Voices?" I asked the shadows.There was no response. Sift slid her legs around my hips.The surface was a churning bowl of light forty meters above us.'What do you miss most of Old Earth's oceans?" I asked.With my left arm I pulled Sift closer, slid my hand down along the curveof her back to where her buttocks rose to meet my palm, held her tight.To the circling dolphins we must have appeared a single-creature. Siftlifted herself against me and we became a single creature.The translator disk had twisted around so it trailed over Siri'sshoulder. I reached to shut it off but paused as the answer to myquestion buzzed urgently in our ears.miss Shark/miss Shark/miss Shark/miss Shark/ Shark/Shark/Shark.I turned off the disk and shook my head. I did not understand.There was so much I did not understand. I closed my eyes as Siri and Imoved gently to the rhythms of the current and ourselves while thedolphins swam nearby and the cadenceof their calls took on the sad, slowtrilling of an old lament.Siri and I came down out of the hills and returned to the Festival justbefore sunrise of the second day. For a night and a day we had roamedthe hills, eaten with strangers in pavilions of orange silk, bathedtogether in the icy waters of the Shree, and danced to the music whichnever ceased going out to the endless file of passing isles. We werehungry.I had awakened at sunset to find Siri gone. She returned before themoon of Maui-Covenant rose. She told me that her parents had gone offwith friends for several days on a slow-moving houseboat. They had leftthe family skimmer in Firstsite. Now we worked our way from dance todance, bonfire to bonfire, back to the center of the city. We plannedto fly west to her family estate ndlr Fevarone.It was very late but Firstsite Common still had its share of revelers. Iwas very happy. I was nineteen and I was in love and the .93 gravity ofMaui-Covenant seemed much less to me. I could have flown had I wished.I could have done anything.We had stopped at a booth and bought fried dough and mugs of blackcoffee. Suddenly a thought struck me.I asked, 'How did you know I was a Shipman?"'Hush, friend Merin. Eat your poor breakfast. When we get to thevilla, I will fix a true meal to break our fast."'No, I'm serious,' I said and wiped grease off my chin with the sleeveof my less than clean Harlequin's costume.'This morning you said that you knew right away last night that I wasfrom the ship. Why was that? Was it my accent? My costume? Mike andI saw other fellows dressed like this."Siri laughed and brushed back her hair. 'Just be glad it was I whospied you out, Merin, my love. Had it been my Uncle Gresham or hisfriends it would have meant trouble."'Oh? Why is that?" I picked up one more fried ring and Sift paid forit. I followed her through the thinning crowd. Despite the motion andthe music all about, I felt weariness beginning to work on me.'They are Separatists,' said Sift. 'Uncle Gresham recently gave aspeech before the Council urging that we fight rather than agree to beswallowed into your Hegemony.He said that we should destroy your farcaster device before it destroysus."'Oh?" I said. 'Did he say how he was going to do that?The last I heard, you folks had no craft to get off-world in."'Nay, nor for the past fifty years have we,' said Siri.'But it shows how irrational the Separatists can be."I nodded. Shipmaster Singh and Councilor Halmyn had briefed us on theso-called Separatists of Maui-Covenant.'The usual coalition of colonial jingoists and throwbacks,' Singh hadsaid. 'Another reason we go slow and develop the world's tradepotential before finishing the fareaster. The Worldweb doesn't needthese yahoos coming in prematurely. And groups like the Separatists areanother reason to keep you crew and construction workers the hell awayfrom the groundlings."'Where is your skimmer?" I asked. The Common was emptying quickly. Mostof the bands had packed up their instruments for the night. Gailycostumed heaps laysnoring on the grass or cobblestones amid the litter and unlit lanterns.Only a few enclaves of merriment remained, groups dancing slowly to alone guitar or singing drunkenly to themselves. I saw Mike Osho atonce, a patchworked fool, his mask long gone, a girl on either arm. Hewas trying to teach the 'Hava Nagilia' to a rapt but inept circle ofadmirers. One of the troupe would stumble and they would all fall down.Mike would flog them to their feet among general laughter and they wouldstart again, hopping clumsily to his basso profundo chant.'There it is,' said Siri and pointed to a short line of skimmers parkedbehind the Common Hall. I nodded and waved to Mike but he was too busyhanging on to his two ladies to notice me. Siri and I had crossed thesquare and were in the shadows of the old building when the shout wentup.'Shipmanl Turn around, you Hegemony son of a bitch."I froze and then wheeled around with fists clenched but no one was nearme. Six young men had descended the steps from the grandstand and werestanding in a semicircle behind Mike. The man in front was tall, slim,and strikingly handsome. He was twenty-five or twenty-six years old andhis long blond curls spilled down on a crimson silk suit that emphasizedhis physique. In his right hand he carried a meter-long sword thatlooked to be of tempered steel.Mike turned slowly. Even from a distance I could see his eyes soberingas he surveyed the situation. The women at his side and a couple of theyoung men in his group tittered as if something humorous had been said.Mike allowed the inebriated grin to stay on his face. 'You address me,sir?" he asked.'I address you, you Hegemony whore's son,' hissed the leader of thegroup. His handsome face was twisted into a sneer.'Bertol,' whispered Siri. 'My cousin. Gresham's younger son." I noddedand stepped out of the shadows.Siri caught my arm.'That is twice you have referred unkindly to mymother, sir,' slurred Mike. 'Have she or I offended you in some way? Ifso, a thousand pardons." Mike bowed so deeply that the bells on his capalmost brushed the ground. Members of his group applauded.'Your presence offends me, you Hegemony bastard.You stink up our air with your fat carcass."Mike's eyebrows rose comically. A young man near him in a fish costumewaved his hand. 'Oh, come on, Bertol. He's just..."'Shut up, Ferick. It is this fat shithead I am speaking to."'Shithead?" repeated Mike, eyebrows still raised. 'I've traveled twohundred light-years to be called a fat shit-head?It hardly seems worth it." He pivoted gracefully, untangling himselffrom the women as he did so. I would have joined Mike then but Siriclung tightly to my arm, whispering unheard entrearies. When I was freeI saw that Mike was still smiling, still playing the fool. But his lefthand was in his baggy shirt pocket.'Give him your blade, Creg,' snapped Bertol. One of the younger mentossed a sword hilt-first to Mike. Mike watched it arc by and clangloudly on the cobblestones.'You can't be serious,' said Mike in a soft voice that was suddenlyquite sober. 'You cretinous cow turd. Do you really think I'm going toplay duel with you just because you get a hard-on acting the hero forthese yokels?"'Pick up the sword,' screamed Bertol, 'or, by God, I'll carve you whereyou stand." He took a quick step forward.The youth's face contorted with fury as he advanced.'Fuck off,' said Mike. In his left hand was the laser pen.'No!" I yelled and ran into the light. That pen was used byconstruction workers to scrawl marks on girders of whiskered alloy.Things happened very quickly then. Bertoi took another step and Mikeflicked the green beam across him almost casually. The colonist let outa cry and leaped back; a smoking line of black was slashed diagonallyacross his silk shirtfront. I hesitated. Mike had thesetting as low as it could go. Two of Bertol's friends started forwardand Mike swung the light across their shins. One dropped to his kneescursing and the other hopped away holding his leg and hooting.A crowd had gathered. They laughed as Mike swept off his fooi's cap inanother bow. 'I thank you,' said Mike. 'My mother thanks you."Siri's cousin strained against his rage. Froths of spittle spilled onhis lips and chin. I pushed through the crowd and stepped between Mikeand the tail colonist.'Hey, it's all right,' I said. 'We're leaving. We're going now.".'Goddamn it, Merin, get out of the way,' said Mike.'It's all right,' I said as I turned to him. 'l'm with a girl namedSiri who has a..." Bertol stepped forward and lunged past me with hisblade. I wrapped my left arm around his shoulder and flung him back. Hetumbled heavily onto the grass.'Oh, shit,' said Mike as he backed up several paces. He looked tiredand a little disgusted as he sat down on a stone step. 'Aw, damn,' hesaid softly. There was a short line of crimson in one of the blackpatches on the left side of his Harlequin costume. As I watched, thenarrow slit spilled over and blood ran down across Mike Osho's broadbelly.'Oh, Jesus, Mike." I tore a strip of fabric from my shirt and tried tostaunch the flow. I could remember none of the first aid we'd beentaught as mid-Shipmen. 1 pawed at my wrist but my cornlog was notthere. We had left them on the Los Angeles.'It's not so bad, Mike,' I gasped. 'It's. just a little cut." Theblood flowed down over my hand and wrist.'It will serve,' said Mike. His voice was held taut by a cord of pain.'Damn. A fucking sword. Do you believe it, Merin? Cut down in theprime of my prime by a piece of fucking cutlery out of a fuckingone-penny opera. Oh, damn, that smarts."'Three-penny opera,' I said and changed hands. The rag was soaked.'You know what your fucking problem is, Merin?You're always sticking your fucking two cents in.Awwwww." Mike's face went white and then gray. He lowered his chin tohis chest and breathed deeply. 'To hell with this, kid. Let's go home,huh?"I looked over my shoulder. Bertol was slowly moving away with hisfriends. The rest of the crowd milled around in shock. 'Call adoctor!" I screamed. 'Get some medics up here!" Two men ran down thestreet. There was no sign of Siri.'Wait a minute! Wait a minute!" said Mike in a stronger voice as if hehad forgotten something important.'Just a minute,' he said and died.Died. A real death. Brain death. His mouth opened obscenely, his eyesrolled back so only the whites showed, and a minute later the bloodceased pumping from the wound.For a few mad seconds I cursed the sky. I could see the L.A. movingacross the fading starfield and I knew that I could bring Mike back if Icould get him there in a few minutes. The crowd backed away as Iscreamed and ranted at the stars.Eventually I turned to Bertol. 'You,' I said.The young man had stopped at the far end of the Common. His face wasashen. He stared wordlessly.'You,' I said again. I picked up the laser pen from where it hadrolled, clicked the power to maximum, and walked to where Bertol and hisfriends stood waiting.Later, through the haze of screams and scorched flesh, I was dimly awareof Siri's skimmer setting down in the crowded square, of dust flying upall around, and of her voice commanding me to join her. We lifted awayfrom the light and madness. The cool wind blew my sweat-soaked hairaway from my neck.'We will go to Fevarone,' said Siri. 'Bertol was drunk.The Separatists are a small, violent group. There will be no reprisals.You will stay with me until the Council holds the inquest."'No,' I said. 'There. Land there." I pointed to a spit of land not farfrom the city.Siri landed despite her protests. I glanced at the boulder to make surethe backpack was still there and then climbed out of the skimmer. Sirislid across the seat andpulled my head down to hers. 'Merin, my love." Her lips were warm andopen but I felt nothing. My body felt anesthetized. I stepped back andwaved her away. She brushed her hair back and stared at me from greeneyes filled with tears. Then the skimmer lifted, turned, and sped tothe south in the early morning light.Just a minute, I felt like calling. I sat on a rock and gripped myknees as several ragged sobs were torn up out of me. Then I stood andthrew the laser pen into the surf below. I tugged out the backpack anddumped the contents on the ground.The hawking mat was gone.I sat back down, too drained to laugh or cry or walk away. The sun roseas I sat there. I was still sitting there three hours later when thelarge black skimmer from ShipSecurity set down silently beside me.'Father? Father, it is getting late."I turn to see my son Donel standing behind me. He is wearing the blueand gold robe of the Hegemony Council.His bald scalp is flushed and beaded with sweat.Donel is only forty-three but he seems much older to me.'Please, Father,' he says. I nod and rise, brushing off the grass anddirt. We walk together to the front of the tomb. The crowd has pressedcloser now. Gravel crunches under their feet as they shift restlessly.'Shall I enter with you, Father?" Donel asks.I pause to look at this aging stranger who is my child.There is little of Siri or me reflected in him. His face is friendly,florid, and tense with the excitement of the day.I can sense in him the open honesty which often takes the place ofintelligence in some people. I cannot help but compare this baldingpuppy of a man to A!bn - A!bn of the dark curls and silences andsardonic smile. But Albn is thirty-three years dead, cut down in astupid battle which had nothing to do with him.'No,' ! say. 'I'll go in by myself. Thank you, Donel." He nods andsteps back. The pennants snap above the heads of the straining crowd. 1turn my attention to the tomb.The entrance is sealed with a palmlock. I have only to touch it.During the past few minutes I have developed a fantasy which will saveme from both the growing sadness within and the external series o fevents which I have initiated. Siri is not dead. In the last stages ofher illness she had called together the doctors and the few techniciansleft in the colony and they rebuilt for her one of the ancienthibernation chambers used in their seedship two centuries earlier.Siri is only sleeping. What is more, the year-long sleep has somehowrestored her youth. When I wake her she will be the Siri I rememberfrom our early days. We will walk out into the sunlight together andwhen the farcaster doorsopen we shall be the first through.'Father?"'Yes." I step forward and set my hand to the door of the crypt. Thereis a whisper of electric motors and the white slab of stone slides back.I bow my head and enter Siri's tomb.'Damn it, Merin, secure that line before it knocks you overboard.Hurry!" I hurried. The wet rope was hard to coil, harder to tie off.Siri shook her head in disgust and leaned over to tie a bowline knotwith one hand.It was our Sixth Reunion. I had been three months too late for herbirthday but more than five thousand other people had made it to thecelebration. The CEO of the All Thing had wished her well in aforty-minute speech. A poet read his most recent verses to the LoveCycle sonnets.The Hegemony Ambassador had presented her with a scroll and a new ship,a small submersible powered by the first fusion cells to be allowed onMaul-Covenant.Siri had eighteen other ships. Twelve belonged to her fleet of swiftcatamarans that plied their trade between the wandering Archipelago andthe home islands. Two were b.autiful racing yachts that were used onlytwice a year to wm the Founder's Regatta and the Covenant Criterium.The other four craft were ancient fishing boats, homely and awkward,well maintained but little more than scows.Siri had nineteen ships but we were on a fishing boat - the Ginnie Paul.For the past eight days we hadfished the shelf of the Equatorial Shallows; a crew of two, casting andpulling nets, wading knee-deep through stinking fish and crunchingtrilobites, wallowing over every wave, casting and pulling nets, keepingwatch, and sleeping like exhausted children during our brief restperiods. I was not quite twenty-three. I thought I was used to heavylabor aboard the L.,4. and it was my custom to put in an hour ofexercise in the 1.3-g pod every second shift, but now my arms and backached from the strain and my hands were blistered between the calluses.Siri had just turned seventy.'Merin, go forward and reef the foresail. Do the same for the jib andthen go below to see to the sandwiches.Plenty of mustard."I nodded and went forward. For a day and a half we had been playinghide-and-seek with a storm: sailing before it when we could, turningabout and accepting its punishment when we had to. At first it had beenexciting, a welcome respite from the endless casting and pulling andmending. But after the first few hours the adrenaline rush faded to bereplaced by constant nausea, fatigue, and a terrible tiredness. Theseas did not relent. The waves grew to six meters and higher. TheGinnie Paul wallowed like the broad-beamed matron she was. Everythingwas wet. My skin was soaked under three layers of rain gear. For Siriit was a long-awaited vacation.'This is nothing,' she had said during the darkest hour of the night aswaves washed over the deck and smashed against the scarred plastic ofthe cockpit. 'You should see it during simoon season."The clouds still hung low and blended into gray waves in the distancebut the sea was down to a gentle five-foot chop. I spread mustardacross the roast beef sandwiches and poured steaming coffee into thickwhite mugs. It would have been easier to transport the coffee in zero-gwithout spilling it than to get up the pitching shaft of thecompanionway. Siri accepted her depleted cup without commenting. Wesat in silence for a bit, appreciating the food and the tongue-scaldingwarmth. I took the wheel when Siri went below to refill our mugs. Thegray day was dimming almost imperceptibly into night.'Merin,' she said after handing me my mug and taking a seat on the longcushioned bench which encircled the cockpit, 'what will happen afterthey open the farcaster?"l was surprised by the question. We had almost never talked about thetime when Maul-Covenant would join the Hegemony. I glanced over at Siriand was struck by how ancient she suddenly seemed. Her face was amosaic of seams and shadows. Her beautiful green eyes had sunken intowells of darkness and her cheekbones were knife edges against brittleparchment. She kept her gray hair cut short now and it stuck out indamp spikes. Her neck and wrists were tendoned cords emerging from ashapeless sweater.'What do you mean?" I asked.'What will happen after they open the farcaster?" 'You know what theCouncil says, Siri." I spoke loudly because she was hard of hearing inone ear. 'It will open a new era of trade and technology forMaul-Covenant.And you won't be restricted to one little world any longer. When youbecome citizens, everyone will be entitled to use the farcaster doors."'Yes,' said Siri. Her voice was weary. 'I have heard all of that,Merin. But what will happen? Who will be the first through to us?"I shrugged. 'More diplomats, I suppose. Cultural contact specialists.Anthropologists. Ethnologists. Marine biologists."'And then?"I paused. It was dark out. The sea was almost gentle.Our running lights glowed red and green against the night. I felt thesame anxiety I had known two days earlier when the wall of stormappeared on the horizon.I said, 'And then will come the missionaries.The petroleum geologists. The sea farmers. The developers. 'Siri sipped at her coffee. 'I would have thought your Hegemony was farbeyond a petroleum economy."I laughed and locked the wheel in. 'Nobody gets beyond a petroleumeconomy. Not while there's petroleum there. We don't burn it, ifthat's what you mean.But it's still essential for the production of plastics, synthetics,food base, and keroids. Two hundred billion people use a lot ofplastic."'And Mani-Covenant has oil?"'Oh, yes,' I said. There was no more laughter in me.'There are billions of barrels reservoired under the Equatorial Shallowsalone."'How will they get it, Merin? Platforms?"'Yeah. Platforms. Submersibles. Sub-sea colonies with tailoredworkers brought in from Mare Infinitus."'And the motile isles?" asked Siri. 'They must return each year to theshallows to feed on the bluekelp there and to reproduce. What willbecome of the isles?"I shrugged again. I had drunk too much coffee and it had left a bittertaste in my mouth. 'I don't know,' I said.'They haven't told the crew much. But back on our first trip out, Mikeheard that they planned to develop as many of the isles as they can sosome will be protected."'Develop?" Siri's voice showed surprise for the first time. 'How canthey develop the isles? Even the First Families must ask permission ofthe Sea Folk to build our treehouse retreats there."I smiled at Siri's use of the local term for the dolphins.The Maul-Covenant colonists were such children when it came to theirdamned dolphins. 'The plans are all set,' I said. 'There are 128,573motile isles big enough to build a dwelling on. Leases to those havelong since been sold.The smaller isles will be broken up, I suppose. The home islands willbe developed for recreation purposes."'Recreation purposes,' echoed Siri. 'How many-peo-ple from the Hegemonywill use the farcaster to come here... for recreation purposes?"'At first, you mean?" I asked. 'Just a few thousand the first year. Aslong as the only door is on Island 241...the Trade Center . . . it will be limited. Perhaps 'fifty thousandthe second year when Firstsite gets its door.It'll be quite the luxury tour. Always is after a seedcolony is first opened to the Web."'And later?"'After the five-year probation? There will be thousands of doors, ofcourse. I would imagine that there willbe twenty or thirty million new residents coming through during thefirst year of full citizenship."'Twenty or thirty million,' said Siri. The light from the compass standilluminated her lined face from below.There was still a beauty there. But there was no anger or shock. I hadexpected both.'But you'll be citizens then yourself,' I said. 'Free to step anywherein the Worldweb. There will be sixteen new worlds to choose from.Probably more by then."'Yes,' said Siri and set aside her empty mug. A fine rain streaked theglass around us. The crude radar screen set in its hand-carved frameshowed the seas empty, the storm past. 'Is it true, Merin, that peoplein the Hegemony have their homes on a dozen worlds? One house, I mean,with windows facing out on a dozen skies?"'Sure,' I said. 'But not many people. Only the rich can affordmultiworld residences like that."Siri smiled and set her hand on my knee. The back of her hand wasmottled and blue-veined. 'But you are very rich, are you not, Shipman?"I looked away. 'Not yet I'm not."'Ah, but soon, Merin, soon. How long for you, my love? Less than twoweeks here and then the voyage back to your Hegemony. Five months moreof your time to bring the last components back, a few weeks to finish,and then you step home a rich man. Step two hundred empty light-yearshome. What a strange thought... but where was I? That is how long?Less than a standard year."'Ten months,' I said. 'Three hundred and six standard days. Threehundred fourteen of yours. Nine hundred eighteen shifts."'And then your exile will be over."'Yes."'And you wili be twenty-four years old and very rich." 'Yes."'I'm tired, Merin. I want to sleep now."We programmed the tiller, set the collision alarm, and went below. Thewind had risen some and the old vesselwallowed from wave crest to trough with every swell. We undressed inthe dim light of the swinging lamp. I was first in the bunk and underthe covers. It was the first time Siri and I had shared a sleep period.Remembering our last Reunion and her shyness at the villa, I expectedher to douse the light. Instead she stood a minute, nude in the chillair, thin arms calmly at her sides.Time had claimed Siri but had not ravaged her. Gravity had done itsinevitable work on her breasts and buttocks and she was much thinner. Istared at the gaunt outlines of ribs and breastbone and remembered thesixteen-year=old girl with baby fat and skin like warm velvet. In thecold light of the swinging lamp I stared at Siri's sagging flesh andremembered moonlight on budding breasts. Yet somehow, strangely,inexplicably, it was the same Siri who stood before me now.'Move over, Merin." She slipped into the bunk beside me. The sheetswere cool against our skin, the rough blanket welcome. I turned off thelight. The little ship swayed to the regular rhythm of the sea'sbreathing. I could hear the sympathetic creak of masts and rigging.In the morning we could be casting and pulling and mending but now therewas time to sleep. I began to dozeto the sound of waves against wood.'Merin?" 'Yes."'What would happen if the Separatists attacked the Hegemony tourists orthe new residents?"'I thought the Separatists had all been carted off to he isles."'They have been. But what if they resisted?"'Tbe Hegemony would send in FORCE troops who could kick the shit out ofthe Separatists."'What if the farcaster itself were attacked ...destroyed before it was operational?"'Impossible."'Yes, I know, but what if it were?"'Then the LosAngeles would return nine months later with Hegemony troopswho would proceed to kick the shit out of the Separatists... and anyoneelse on Maui-Covenant who got in their way."'Nine months' shiptime,' said Siri. 'Eleven years of our time."'But inevitable either way,' I said. 'Let's talk about something else."'All right,' said Siri but we did not speak. I listened to the crackand sigh of the ship. Siri had nestled in the hollow of my arm. Herhead was on my shoulder and her breathing was so deep and regular that Ithought her to be asleep. I was almost asleep myself when her warm handslid up my leg and lightly cupped me. I was startled even as I began tostir and stiffen. Siri whispered an answer to my unasked question. 'No,Merin, one is never really too old.At least not too old to want the warmth and closeness.You decide, my love. I will be content either way."I decided. Toward the dawn we slept.The tomb is empty.'Donel, come in here!'He bustles in, robes rustling in the hollow emptiness.The tomb/s empty. There is no hibernation chamber - I did not trulyexpect there to be one - but neither is there sarcophagus or coffin. Abright bulb illuminates the white interior. 'What the hell is this,Donel? I thought this was Siri's tomb."'It is, Father."'Where is she interred? Under the floor for Chrissake?" Donel mops athis brow. I remember that it is his mother I am speaking of. I alsoremember that he has had almosttwo years to accustom himself to the idea of her death.'No one told you?" he asks.'Told me what?" The anger and confusion are already ebbing. 'I wasrushed here from the dropship station and told that I was to visitSiri's tomb before the farcaster opening. What?"'Mother was cremated as per her instructions. Her ashes were spread onthe Great South Sea from the highest platform of the family isle."'Then why this... crypt?" I watch what I say. Donel is sensitive.He mops his brow again and glances to the door. We are shielded fromthe view of the crowd but we are far behindschedule. Already the other members of the Council have had to hurrydown the hill to join the dignitaries on the bandstand. My slow griefthis day has been worse than bad timing - it has turned into badtheater.'Mother left instructions. They were carried out." He touches a panelon the inner wall and it slides up to reveala small niche containing a metal box. My name is on it.'What is that?"Donel shakes his head. 'Personal items Mother left for you. OnlyMagritte knew the details and she died last winter without tellinganyone."'All right,' I say. 'Thank you. I'll be out in a moment." Donelglances at his chronometer. 'The ceremony begins in eight minutes. Theywill activate the farcaster in twenty minutes."'I know,' I say. I do know. Part of me knows precisely how much timeis left. 'VII be out in a moment."Donel hesitates and then departs. I close the door behind him with atouch of my palm. The metal box is surprisingly heavy. I set it on thestone floor and crouch beside it. A smaller palmlock gives me access.The lid clicks open and I peer into the container.'Well I'll be damned,' I say softly. I do not know what I expected-artifacts perhaps, nostalgic mementos of our hundred and three daystogether - perhaps a pressed flower from some forgotten offering or thefrenchhorn conch we dove for off Fevarone. But there are no mementos -not as such.The box holds a small Steiner-Ginn handlaser, one of the most powerfulprojection weapons ever made. The accumulator is attached by a powerlead to a small fusion cell that Siri must have cannibalized from hernew submersible. Also attached to the fusion cell is an ancientcornlog, an antique with a solid state interior and a liquid crystaldiskey. The charge indicator glows green.There are two other objects in the box. One is the translator medallionwe had used so long ago. The final object makes me literally gape insurprise.'Why, you little bitch,' I say. Things fall into place. I cannot stopa smile. 'You dear, conniving, little bitch."There, rolled carefully, power lead correctly attached,lies the hawking mat Mike Osho bought in Carvnel Marketplace for thirtymarks. I leave the hawking mat there, disconnect the comlog, and liftit out. I sit crosslegged on the cold stone and thumb the diskey. Thelight in the crypt fades out and suddenly Siri is there before me.They did not throw me off the ship when Mike died.They could have but they did not. They did not leave me to the mercy ofprovincial justice on Maui-Covenant.They could have but they chose not to. For two days 1 was held inSecurity and questioned, once by Shipmaster Singh himself. Then theylet me return to duty. For the four months of the long leap back Itortured myself with the memory of Mike's murder. I knew that in myclumsy way I had helped to murder him. I put in my shifts, dreamed mysweaty nightmares, and wondered if they would dismiss me when we reachedthe Web. They could have told me but they chose not to.They did not dismiss me. I was to have my normal leave in the Web butcould take no off-Ship R and R while in the Maui-Covenant system. Inaddition, there was a written reprimand and temporary reduction in rank.That was what Mike's life had been worth- a reprimand and reduction inrank.I took my three-week. leave with the rest of the crew but, unlike theothers, I did not plan to return. I farcast to Esperance and made theclassic Shipman's mistake of trying to visit family. Two days in thecrowded residential bulb was enough and I stepped to Lusus and took mypleasure in three days of whoring on the Rue des Chats.When my mood turned darker I 'cast to Fuji and lost most of my readymarks betting on the bloody samurai fights there.Finally 1 found myself farcasting to Homesystem Station and taking thetwo-day pilgrim shuttle down to Hellas Basin. I had never been toHomesystem or Mars before and I never plan to return, but the ten days Ispent there, alone and wandering the dusty, haunted corridors of theMonastery, served to send me back to the ship.Back to Siri.Occasionally I would leave the red-stoned maze of themegalith and, clad only in skinsuit and mask, stand on one of theuncounted thousands of stone balconies and stare skyward at the palegray star which had once been Old Earth. Sometimes then I thought ofthe brave and stupid idealists heading out into the great dark in theirslow and leaking ships, carrying embryos and ideologies with equal faithand care. But most times I did not try to think. Most times I simplystood in the purple night and let Siri come to me. There in theMaster's Rock, where perfect satori had eluded so many much worthierpilgrims, I achieved it through the memory of a not quitesixteen-year-old womanchild's body lying next to mine while moonlightspilled from a Thomas Hawk's wings.When the Los Angeles spun back up to a quantum state, I went with her.Four months later I was content to pull my shift with the constructioncrew, plug into my usual stims, and sleep my R and R away. Then Singhcame to me. 'You're going down,' he said. I did not understand. 'Inthe past eleven years the groundlings have turned your screw-up withOsho into a goddamned legend,' said Singh. 'There's an entire culturalmythos built around your little roll in the hay with that colonialgirl."'Siri,' I said.'Get your gear,' said Singh. 'You'll spend your three weeks groundside.The Ambassador's experts say you'll do the Hegemony'more good down therethan up here.We'll see."The world was waiting. Crowds were cheering. Siri was waving. We leftthe harbor in a yellow catamaran and sailed south-southeast, bound forthe Archipelago and her family isle.'Hello, Merin." Siri floats in the darkness of her tomb.The holo is not perfect; a haziness mars the edges. But it is Siri -Siri as I last saw, gray hair shorn rather than cut, head high, facesharpened with shadows. 'Hello, Merin, my love."'Hello, Siri,' I say. The tomb door is closed.'I am sorry I cannot share our Seventh Reunion, Merin. I looked forwardto it." Siri pauses and looksdown at her hands. The image flickers slightly as dust motes floatthrough her form. 'I had carefully planned what to say here,' she goeson. 'How to say it. Arguments to be pied. Instructions to be given.But I know how useless that would have been. Either I have said italready and you have heard or there is nothing left to say and silencewould best suit the moment."Siri's voice had grown even more beautiful with age.There is a fullness and calmness there which can come only from knowingpain. Siri moves her hands and they disappear beyond the border of theprojection. 'Merin, my love, how strange our days apart and togetherhave been. How beautifully absurd the myth that bound us.My days were but heartbeats to you. I hated you for that.You were the mirror that would not lie. If you could have seen yourface at the beginning of each Reunion! The least you could have donewas to hide your shock...that, at least, you could have done for me.'But through your clumsy naivet there has always been... what?...something, Merin. There is something there that belies the callowhessand thoughtless egotism which you wear so well. A caring, perhaps. Arespect for caring, if nothing else.'Merin, this diary has hundreds of entries... thousands, I fear... Ihave kept it since I was thirteen. By the time you see this, they willall have been erased except the ones which follow. Adieu, my love.Adieu."I shut off the comlog and sit in silence for a minute. The crowd soundsare barely audible through the thick walls of the tomb. I take a breathand thumb the diskey.Siri appears. She is in her late forties. I know immediately the dayand place she recorded this image. I remember the cloak she wears, theeelstone pendant at her neck, and the strand of hair which has escapedher barrette and even now falls across her cheek. I remember everythingabout that day. It was the last day of our Third Reunion and we werewith friends on the heights above South Tern. Donel was ten and we weretrying to convince him to slide on the snowfield with us. He wascrying. Siri turned away from us even before the skimmer settled.When Magritte stepped out we knew from Siri's face that something hadhappened.The same face stares at me now. She brushes absently at the unrulystrand of hair. Her eyes are red but her voice is controlled. 'Merin,they killed our son today.Albn was twenty-one and they killed him. You were so confused today,Merin. "How could such a mistake have happened?" you kept repeating.You did not really know our son but I could see the loss in your facewhen we heard. Merin, it was not an accident. If nothing elsesurvives, no other record, if you never understand why I allowed asentimental myth to rule my life, let this be known - it was not anaccident that killed Albn. He was with the Separatists when the Councilpolice arrived.Even then he could have escaped. We had prepared an alibi together. Thepolice would have believed his story.He chose to stay.'Today, Merin, you were impressed with what I said to the crowd... themob... at the embassy. Know this, Shipman - when I said, "Now is notthe time to show your anger and your hatred," that is precisely what Imeant. No more, no less. Today is not the time. But the day willcome. It will surely come. The Covenant was not taken lightly in thosefinal days, Merin. It is not taken lightly now. Those who haveforgotten will be surprised when the day comes but it will surely come."The image fades to another and in the split second of overlap the faceof a twenty-six-year-old Siri appears superimposed on the older woman'sfeatures. 'Merin, I am pregnant. I'm so glad. You've been gone fiveweeks now and I miss. you. Ten years you'll be gone. More than that.Merin, why didn't you think to invite me to go with you? I could nothave gone but I would have loved it if you had just invited me. But I'mpregnant, Merin. The doctors say that it will be a boy. I will tellhim about you, my love. Perhaps someday you and he will sail in theArchipelago and listen to the songs of the Sea Folk as you and I havedone these past few weeks. Perhaps you'll understand them by then.Merin, I miss' you. Please hurry back."The holographic image shimmers and shifts. The sixteen-year-old girl isred-faced. Her long hair cascades over bare shoulders and a whitenightgown. She speaks in a rush, racing tears. 'Shipman Merin Aspic,I'm sorry about your friend - I really am - but you left without evensaying goodbye. I had such plans about how you would help us... howyou and I... you didn't even say goodbye. I don't care what happens toyou. I hope you go back to your stinking, crowded Hegemony hives androt for all I care. In fact, Merin Aspic, I wouldn't want to see youagain even if they paid me. Goodbye."She turns her back before the projection fades. It is dark in the tombnow but the audio continues for a second. There is a soft chuckle andSiri's voice - I cannot tell the age - comes one last time. 'Adieu,Merin.Adieu."'Adieu,' I say and thumb the diskey off.The crowd parts as I emerge blinking from the tomb. My poor timing hasruined the drama of the event and now the smile on my face incites angrywhispers. Loudspeakers carry the rhetoric of the official ceremony evento our hilltop. '... beginning a new era of cooperation,' echoes therich voice of the Ambassador.I set the box on the grass and remove the hawking mat.The crowd presses forward to see as I unroll the carpet.The tapestry is faded but the flight threads gleam like new copper. Isit in the center of the mat and slide the heavy box on behind me.'... and more will follow until space and time will cease to beobstacles."The crowd moves back as I tap the flight design and the hawking matrises four meters into the air. Now I can see beyond the roof of thetomb. The islands are returning to form the Equatorial Archipelago. Ican see them, hundreds of them, borne up out of the hungry south bygentle winds.'So it is with great' pleasure that I close this circuit and welcomeyou, the colony of Maui-Covenant, into the community of the Hegemony ofMan."The thin thread of the ceremonial comm-laser pulsesto the zenith. There is a spattering of applause and the band beginsplaying. I squint skyward just in time to see a new star being born.Part of me knew to the microsecond what has just occurred.For a few microseconds the farcaster had been functional.For a few microseconds time and space had ceased to be obstacles. Thenthe massive tidal pull of the artificial singularity triggered thethermite charge I had placed on the outer containment sphere. That tinyexplosion had not been visible but a second later the expandingSchwarzschild radius is eating its shell, swallowing thirty-six thousandtons of fragile dodecahedron, and growing quickly to gobble severalthousand kilometers of space around it. And that is visible -magnificently visible - as a miniature nova flares whitely in the clearblue sky.The band stops playing. People scream and run for cover. There is noreason to. There is a burst of X rays tunneling out as the farcastercontinues to collapse into itself, but not enough to cause harm throughMaui-Covenant's generous atmosphere. A second streak of plasma becomesvisible as the Los Angeles puts more distance between itself and therapidly decaying little black hole. The winds rise and the seas arechoppier.There will be strange tides tonight.I want to say something profound but I can think of nothing. Besides,the crowd is in no mood to listen. I tell myself that I can hear somecheers mixed in with the screams and shouts.I tap at the flight designs and the hawking mat speeds out over thecliff and above the harbor. A Thomas Hawk lazing on midday thermalsflaps in panic at my approach.'Let them come!" I shout at the fleeing hawk. 'Let them come! I'll bethirty-five and not alone and let them come if they dare!" I drop myfist and laugh. The wind is blowing my hair and cooling the sweat on mychest and arms.Cooler now, I take a sighting and set my course for the most distant ofthe isles. I look forward to meeting the others. Even more, I lookforward to talking to the SeaFolk and telling them that it is time for the Shark to come at last tothe seas of Maui-Covenant.Later, when the battles are won and the world is theirs, I will tellthem about her. I will sing to them of Siri.The cascade of light from the distant space battle continued.There was no sound except for the slide of wind across escarpments. Thegroup sat close together, leaning forward and looking at the antiquecomlog as if expecting more.There was no more. The Consul removed the micro-disk and pocketed it.Sol Weintraub rubbed the back of his sleeping infant and spoke to theConsul. 'Surely you!re not Merin Aspic."'No,' said the Consul. 'Merin Aspic died during the Rebellion. Siri'sRebellion."'How did you come to possess this recording?" asked Father Hoyt. Throughthe priest's mask of pain, it was visible that he had been moved. 'Thisincredible recording..."'He gave it to me,' said the Consul. 'A few weeks before he was killedin the Battle of the Archipelago." The Consul looked at theuncomprehending faces before him. 'I'm their grandson,' he said.'Siri's and Merin's.My father ... the Donel whom Aspic mentions ...became the first Home Rule Councilor when Maui-Covenant was admitted tothe Protectorate. Later he was elected Senator and served until hisdeath. I was nine years old that day on the hill near Siri's tomb. Iwas twenty - old enough to join the rebels and fight -- when Aspic cameto our isle at night, took me aside, and forbade me to join their band."'Would you have fought?" asked Brawne Lamia.'Oh, yes. And died. Like a third of our menfolk and a fifth of ourwomen. Like all of the dolphins and many of the isles themselves,although the Hegemony tried to keep as many of those intact aspossible."'It is a moving document,' said Sol Weintraub. 'But why are you here?Why the pilgrimage to the Shrike?"'I am not finished,' said the Consul. 'Listen."My father was as weak as my grandmother had been strong. The Hegemonydid not wait eleven local years to return - the FORCE torchships were inorbit before five years had elapsed. Father watched as the rebels'hastily constructed ships were swatted aside. He continued to defendthe Hegemony as they laid siege to our world. I remember when I wasfifteen, watching with my family from the upper deck of our ancestralisle as a dozen other islands burned in the distance, the Hegemonyskimmers lighting the sea with their depth charges. In the morning, thewaves were gray with the bodies of the dead dolphins.My older sister Lira went to fight with the rebels in those hopelessdays after the Battle of the Archipelago.Eyewitnesses saw her die. Her body was never recovered.My father never mentioned her name again.Within three years after the cease-fire and admission to theProtectorate, we original colonists were a minority on our own world.The isles were tamed and said to tourists, just as Merin had predictedto Siri. Firstsite is a city of eleven million now, the condos andspires and EM cities extending around the entire island along the coast.Firstsite Harbor remains as a quaint bazaar, with descendants of theFirst Families selling crafts and overpriced art there.We lived on Tau Ceti Center for a while when Father was first electedSenator, and I finished school there. I was the dutiful son, extollingthe virtues of life in the Web, studying the glorious history of theHegemony of Man, andpreparing for my own career in the diplomatic corps.And all the time I waited.I returned to Maul-Covenant briefly after graduation, working in theoffices on Central Administration Isle.Part of my job was to visit the hundreds of drilling platforms going upin the shallows, to report on the rapidly multiplying underseacomplexes, and to act as liaison with the development corporationscoming in from TC and Sol Draconi Septem. I did not enjoy the work. ButI was efficient. And I smiled. And I waited.I courted and married a girl from one of the FirstFamilies, from Siri's cousin Bertol's line, and after receiving a rare'First' on diplomatic corps examinations, I requested a post out of theWeb.Thus began our personal Diaspora, Gresha's and mine. I was efficient. Iwas born to diplomacy. Within .five standard years I was an UnderConsul. Within eight, a Consul in my own right. As long as I stayed inthe Outback, this was as far as I would rise.It was my choice. I worked for the Hegemony. And I waited.At first my role was to provide Web ingenuity to help the colonists dowhat they do best - destroy truly indigenous life. It is no. accidentthat in six centuries of interstellar expansion the Hegemony hasencountered no species considered intelligent on the Drake- Turing-ChenIndex. On Old Earth, it had long been accepted that if a species putmankind on itsfood-chain menu the species would be extinct before long.As the Web expanded, if a species attempted serious competition withhumanity's intellect, that species wouM be extinct before the firstfarcaster opened in-system.On Whirl we stalked the elusive zeplen through their cloud towers. Itis possible that they were not sapient by human or Core standards. Butthey were beautiful.When they died, rippling in rainbow colors, their many-hued messagesunseen, unheard by their fleeing herdmates, the beauty of their deathagony was beyond words. We sam their photoreceptive skins to Webcorporations, their flesh to worlds like Heaven's Gate, and ground theirbones to powder to sell as aphrodisiacs to the impotent andsuperstitious on a score of other colony worlds.On Garden I was adviser to the arcology engineers who drained Grand Fen,ending the short reign of the marsh centaurs who had ruled- andthreatened Hegemony progress - there. They tried to migrate in the end,but the North Reaches were far too dry and when I visited the regiondecades later, when Garden entered the Web, the desiccated remains ofthe centaurs still littered some of the distant Reaches like the husksof exotic plants from some more colorful era.On Hebron I arrived just as the Jewish settlers were ending their longfeud with the Seneschal Aluit, creatures as fragile as the world'swaterless ecology. The Aluit were empathic and it was our fear andgreed which killed them - that and our unbreachable alienness. But onHebron it was not the death of the Aluit which turned my heart to stone,but my part in dooming the colonists themselves.On Old Earth they had a word for what I was-quisling.For, although Hebron was not my world, the settlers who had fled therehad done so for reasons as clear as those of my ancestors who signed theCovenant of Life on the Old Earth island of MauL But I was waiting. Andin my waiting I acted... in all senses of the word.They trusted me. They grew to believe in my candid revelations of howwonderful it was to rejoin the community of mankind... to join the Web.They insisted that only the one city might be open to foreigners. Ismiled and agreed. And now New Jerusalem holds sixty millions while thecontinent holds ten million Jewish indigenies, dependent upon the Webcity for most of what they need. Another decade. Perhaps less.I broke down a bit after Hebron was opened to the Web. I discoveredalcohol, the blessed antithesis of Flashback and wireheading. Greshastayed with me in the hospital there until I dried out. Oddly, for aJewish world, the clinic was Catholic. I remember the rustle of robesin the halls at night.My breakdown had been very quiet and very far away.My career was not damaged. As full Consul, I took my wife and son toBressia.How delicate our role there! How Byzantine the fine line we walked. Fordecades, Colonel Kassad, forces of the TechnoCore had been harassing theOuster swarms wherever they fled. Now the forces-that-be in the Senateand AI Advisory Council had determined that some test had to be made ofOuster might in the Outback itself.Bressia was chosen. I admit, the Bressians had been our surrogates fordecades before I arrived. Their society.was archaically and delightfully Prussian, militaristic to a fault,arrogant in their economic pretensions, xenophobic to the point ofhappily enlisting to wipe out the 'Ouster Menace." A t first, a fewlend-lease torchships so that they could reach the swarms. Plasmaweapons.Impact probes with tailored viruses.It was a slight miscalculation that I was still on Bressia when theOuster hordes arrived. A few months' difference.A military-political analysis team should have been there in my place.It did not matter. Hegemony purposes were served.The resolve and rapid-deployment capabilities of FORCE were properlytested where no real harm was done to Hegemony interests. Gresha died,of course. In the first bombardment. And A!On, my ten-year-old son.He had been with me... had survived the war itself...only to die when some FORCE idiot set off a booby trap or demolitioncharge too near the refugee barracks in Buckminster, the capital.I was not with him when he died.I was promoted after Bressia. I was given the most challenging andsensitive assignment ever relegated to someone of mere consular rank:diplomat in charge of direct negotiations with the Ousters themselves.First I was 'cast to Tau Ceti Center for long conferences with SenatorGladstone's committee and some of the AI Councilors. I met withGladstone herself. The plan was very complicated. Essentially theOusters had to be provoked into attacking, and the key to thatprovocation was the world of Hyperion.The Ousters had been observing Hyperion since before the Battle ofBressia. Our intelligence suggested that they were obsessed with theTime Tombs and the Shrike. Their attack on the Hegemony hospital shipcarrying Colonel Kassad, among others, had been a miscalculation; theirship captain had panicked when the hospital ship had been mistakenlyidentified as a military spinship. Worse, from the Ousters' point ofview, was the fact that by setting their dropships down near the Tombsthemselves, the same commander had revealed their ability to defy thetime tides. After the Shrike haddecimated their commando teams, the torchship captain returned to theSwarm to be executed.But our intelligence suggested that the Ouster miscalculation had notbeen a total disaster. Valuable information had been obtained about theShrike. And their obsession with Hyperion had deepened.Gladstone explained to me how the Hegemony planned to capitalize on thatobsession.The essence of the plan was that the Ousters had to be provoked intoattacking the Hegemony. The focus of that attack was to be Hyperionitself. I was made to understand that the resulting battle had more todo with internal Web politics than with the Ousters. Elements of theTechnoCore had opposed Hyperion's entry into the Hegemony for centuries.Gladstone explained that this was no longer in the interest of humanityand that a forcible annexation of Hyperion - under the guise ofdefending the Web itself- would allow more progressive Al coalitions inthe Core to gain power. This shift of the power balance in the Corewould benefit the Senate and the Web in ways not fully explained to me.The Ousters would be eradicated as a potential menace once and for all.A new era of Hegemony glory would begin.Gladstone explained that I need not volunteer, that the mission would befraught with dangers - both for my career and my life. I acceptedanyway.The Hegemony provided me with a private spacecraft.I asked for only one modification: the addition of an an tique Stein waypiano.For months I traveled alone under Hawking drive. For more months Iwandered in regions where the Ouster Swarms regularly migrated.Eventually my ship was sensed and seized. They accepted that I was acourier and knew that I was a spy. They debated killing me and did not.They debated negotiating with me and eventually decided to do so.I will not try to describe the beauty of life in a Swarm - theirzero-gravity globe cities and comet farms and thrust clusters, theirmicro-orbital forests and migrating rivers and the ten thousand colorsand textures of life at Rendezvous Week. Suffice it to say that Ibelieve the Ousters have done what Web humanity has not in the pastmillennia: evolved. While we llve in our derivative cultures, palereflections of Old Earth life, the Ousters have explored new dimensionsof aesthetics and ethics and biosciences and art and all the things thatmust change and grow to reflect the human soul.Barbarians, we call them, while all the while we timidly cling to ourWeb like Visigoths crouching in the ruins of Rome's faded glory andproclaim ourselves civilized.Within ten standard months, I had told them my greatest secret and theyhad told me theirs. I explained in all the detail I could what plansfor extinction had been laid for them by Gladstone's people. I toldthem what little the Web scientists understood of the ttnomaly of theTime Tombs and revealed the TechnoCore's inexplicable fear of Hyperion.I described how Hyperion would be a trap for them if they dared attemptto occupy it, how every element of FORCE would be brought to HyperionSystem to crush them. I revealed everything I knew and waited onceagain to die.Instead of killing me, they told me something. They showed me fatlineintercepts, tightbeam recordings, and their own records from the datethey fled Old Earth System, four and a half centuries earlier. Theirfacts were terrible and simple.The Big Mistake of '38 had been no mistake. The death of Old Earth hadbeen deliberate, planned by elements of the TechnoCore and their humancounterparts in the fledgling government of the Hegemony. The Hegirahad been planned in detail decades before the runaway black hole had'accidentally' been plunged into the heart of Old Earth.The Worldweb, the All Thing, the Hegemony of Man - allof them had beenbuilt on the most vicious type of patricide. Now they were beingmaintained by a quiet and deliberate policy of fraticide - the murder ofany species with even the slightest potential of being a competitor.And the Ousters, the only other tribe of humanity free to wander betweenthe stars and the only group not dominated by the TechnoCore, was nexton our list of extinction.I returned to the Web. Over thirty years of Web-time had passed. MeinaGladstone was CEO. Siri's Rebellion was a romantic legend, a minorfootnote in the history of the Hegemony.I met with Gladstone. I told her many - but not all -of the things theOusters had revealed. I told her that they knew that any battle forHyperion would be a trap, but that they were coming anyway. I told herthat the Ousters wanted me to become Consul on Hyperion so that I mightbe a double agent when war came.I did not tell her that they had promised to give me a device whichwould open the Time Tombs and allow the Shrike free rein.,CEO Gladstone had long talks with me. FORCE: Intelligence agents hadeven longer talks with me, some lasting months. Technologies and drugswere used to confirm that I was telling the truth and keeping nothingback. The Ousters also had been very good with technologies and drugs.I was telling the truth. I was also keeping something back.In the end, I was assigned to Hyperion. Gladstone offered to raise theworld to Protectorate status and me to an ambassadorship. I declinedboth offers, although I asked if I could keep my private spacecraft. Iarrived on a regularly scheduled spinship, and my own ship arrivedseveral weeks later in the belly of a visiting torchship. It was leftin a parking orbit with the understanding that I could summon it andleave any time I wished.Alone on Hyperion, I waited. Years passed. I allowed my aide to governthe Outback world while I drank at Cicero's and waited.The Ousters contacted me through private fatline and I took a threeweeks' leave from the Consulate, brought my ship down to an isolatedplace near the Sea of Grass, rendezvoused with their scoutship near theOOrt Cloud, picked up their agent - a woman named Andil - and a trio oftechnicians, and dropped down north of the Bridle Range, a fewkilometers from the Tombs themselves.The Ousters did not have farcasters. They spent their lives on the longmarches between the stars, watching life in the Web speed by like somefilm or holie set at a frenzied speed. They were obsessed with time.The TechnoCore had given the Hegemony the farcaster and continued tomaintain it. No human scientists or team of human scientists had comeclose to understanding it. The Ousters tried. They failed. But evenin their failures they made inroads into understanding the manipulationof space/time.They understood the time tides, the anti-entropic fields surrounding theTombs. They could not generate such fields, but they could shieldagainst them and-theoretically - collapse them. The Time Tombs and alltheir contents would cease to age backward. The Tombs would 'open. 'The Shrike would slip its tether, no longer connected to the vicinity ofthe Tombs. Whatever else was inside would now be freed.The Ousters believed that the Time Tombs were artifacts from theirfuture, the Shrike a weapon of redemption awaiting the proper hand toseize it. The Shrike Cult saw the monster as an avenging angel; theOusters saw it as a tool of human devising, sent back through time todeliver humanity from the TechnoCore. Andil and the technicians werethere to calibrate and experiment.'You won't use it now?" I asked. We were standing in the shadow of thestructure called the Sphinx.'Not now,' said Andil. 'When the invasion is imminent."'But you said it would take months for the device to work,' I said, forthe Tombs to open."Andil nodded. Her eyes were a dark green. She was very tall, and Icould make out the subtle stripes of the powered exoskeleton on herskinsuit. 'Perhaps a year or longer,' she said. 'The device causes theanti-entropic field to decay slowly. But once begun, the process isirrevocable. But we will not activate it until the Ten Councils havedecided that invasion of the Web is necessary. ''There are doubts?" I said.'Ethical debates,' said A ndii. A few meters from us, the threetechnicians were covering the device with chameleon cloth and a codedcontainment field. 'And interstellar war will cause the deaths ofmillions, perhapsbillions. Releasing the Shrike into the Web will have unforeseenconsequences. As much as we need to strike at the Core, there aredebates as to which is the best way. 'I nodded and looked at the device and the valley of the Tombs. 'Butonce this is activated,' I said, 'there is no turning back. The Shrikewill be released, and you willhave to have won the war to control it?"Andil smiled slightly. 'That is true."I shot her then, her and then the three technicians.Then I tossed Grandmother Siri's Steiner-Ginn laser far into the driftdunes and sat on an empty flowfoam crate and sobbed for several minutes.Then I walked over, used a techniciqn's cornlog to enter the containmentfield, threw off the chameleon cloth, and triggered the device.There was no immediate change. The air held the same rich, late-winterlight. The Jade Tomb glowed softly while the Sphinx continued to staredown at nothing.The only sound was the rasp of sand across the crates and bodies. Onlya glowing indicator on the Ouster device showed that it was working ...had already worked.I walked slowly back to the ship, half expecting the Shrike to appear,half hoping that it would. I sat on the balcony of my ship for morethan an hour, watching the shadows filling the valley and the sandcovering the distant corpses. There was no Shrike. No thorn tree.After a while I played a Bach Prelude on the Steinway, buttoned up theship, and rose into space.I contacted the Ouster ship and said that there had been an accident.The Shrike had taken the others; the device had been activatedprematurely. Even in their confusion and panic, the Ousters offered merefuge. I declined the offer and turned my ship toward the Web.The Ousters did not pursue.I used myfatline transmitter to contact Gladstone and to tell her thatthe Ouster agents had been eliminated. !told her that the invasion was very likely, that the trap would besprung as planned. I did not tell her about the device. Gladstonecongratulated me and called me home. I declined. I told her that Ineeded silence and solitude. I turned my ship toward the Outback worldnearest the Hyperion system, knowing that travel itself would eat timeuntil the next act commenced.Later, when the fatline call to pilgrimage came from Gladstone herself,I knew the role the Ousters had planned for me in these final days: theOusters, or the Core, or Gladstone and her machinations. It no longermatters who consider themselves the masters of events.Events no longer obey their masters.The world as we know it is ending, my friends, no matter what happens tous. As for me, I have no request of the Shrike. I bring no final wordsfor it or the universe.I have returned because I must, because this is my fate. I've knownwhat I must do since I was a child, returning alone to Siri's tomb andswearing vengeance on the Hegemony. I've known what price I must pay,both in life and in history.But when the time comes to judge, to understand a betrayal which willspread like fame across the Web, which will end worlds, l ask you not tothink of me - my name was not even writ on water as your lost poet'ssoul said - but to think of Old Earth dying for no reason, to think ofthe dolphins, their gray flesh drying and rotting in the sun, to see -as I have seen - the motile isles with no place to wander, their feedinggrounds destroyed, the Equatorial Shallows scabbed with drillingplatforms, the islands themselves burdened with shouting, trammelingtourists smelling of UV lotion and cannabis.Or better yet, think of none of that. Stand as l did after throwing theswitch, a murderer, a betrayer, but still proud, feet firmly planted onHyperion's shifting sand, head held high, fist raised against the sky,crying 'A plague on both your houses.t'For you see, I remember my grandmother's dream. I remember the way itcould have been.I remember Siri.'Are you the spy?" asked Father Hoyt. 'The Ouster spy?"The Consul rubbed his cheeks and said nothing. He looked tired, spent.'Yeah,' said Martin Silenus. 'CEO Gladstone warnedme when I was chosen for the pilgrimage. She said that there was aspy."'She told all of us,' snapped Brawne Lamia. She stared at the Consul.Her gaze seemed sad.'Our friend is a spy,' said Sol Weintraub, 'but not merely an Ousterspy." The baby had awakened.Weintraub lifted her to calm her crying. 'He is what they call in thethrillers a double agent, a triple agent in this case, an agent toinfinite regression. In truth, an agent of retribution."The Consul looked at the old scholar.'He's still a spy,' said Silenus. 'Spies are executed, aren't they?" ,Colonel Kassad had the deathwand in his hand. It was not aimed inanyone's direction. 'Are you in touch withyour ship?" he asked the Consul.'Yes." 'How?"'Through Siri's comlog. It was... modified."Kassad nodded slightly. 'And you've been in touchwith the Ousters via the ship's fatline transmitter?" 'Yes."'Making reports on the pilgrimage as they expected?" 'Yes."'Have they replied?"'No."'How can we believe him?" cried the poet. 'He's a fucking spy."'Shut up,' Colonel Kassad said flatly, finally. His gaze never left theConsul. 'Did you attack Her Masteen?"'No,' said the Consul. 'But when the Yggdrasiliburned, I knew that something was wrong."'What do you mean?" said Kassad.The Consul cleared his throat. 'I've spent time with Templar Voices ofthe Tree. Their connection to their treeships is almost telepathic.Masteen's reaction was far too subdued. Either he wasn't what he saidhe was, or he had known that the ship was to be destroyed and hadsevered contact with it. When I was on guard duty, 1 went below toconfront him. He was gone. The cabin was as we found it, except forthe fact that the MObius cube was in a neutral state. The erg couldhave escaped. I secured it and went above."'You did not harm Het Masteen?" Kassad asked again.'No."'1 repeat, why the fuck should we believe you?" said Silenus. The poetwas drinking Scotch from the last bottle he had brought along.The Consul looked at the bottle as he answered. 'You have no reason tobelieve me. It doesn't matter."Colonel Kassad's long fingers idly tapped the dull casing of thedeathwand. 'What will you do with your fatline commlink now?"The Consul took a tired breath. 'Report when the Time Tombs open. IfI'm still alive then."Brawne Lamia pointed at the antique comlog. 'We could destroy it."The Consul shrugged.'It could be of use,' said the Colonel. 'We can eavesdrop on militaryand civilian transmissions made in the clear. If we have to, we cancall the Consul's ship."'No!" cried the Consul. It was the first time he had shown emotion inmany minutes. 'We can't turn back now."'l believe we have no intention of turning back,' said Colonel Kassad.He looked around at pale faces. No one spoke for a moment.'There is a decision we have to make,' said Sol Weintraub. He rockedhis infant and nodded in the direction of the Consul.Martin Silenus had been resting his forehead on the mouth of the emptybottle of Scotch. He looked up. 'The penalty for treason is death." Hegiggled. 'We're all going to die within a few hours anyway. Why notmake our last act an execution?"Father Hoyt grimaced as a spasm of pain gripped him.He touched his cracked lips with a trembling finger.'We're not a court."'Yes,' said Colonel Kassad, 'we are."The Consul drew up his legs, rested his forearms on his knees, and lacedhis fingers. 'Decide then." There was no emotion in his voice.Brawne Lamia had brought out her father's automatic pistol. Now she setit on the floor near where she sat. Her eyes darted from the Consul toKassad. 'We're talking treason here?" she said. 'Treason toward what?None of us except maybe the Colonel there is exactly a leading citizen.We've all been kicked around by forces beyond our control."Sol Weintraub spoke directly to the Consul. 'What you have ignored, myfriend, is that if Meina Gladstone and elements of the Core chose youfor the Ouster contact, they knew very well what you would do. Perhapsthey could not have guessed that the Ousters had the means by which oopen the Tombs - although with the Als of the Core one can never know -but they certainly knew that you would turn on both societies, bothcamps which have injured your family. It is all part of some bizarreplan. You were no more an instrument of your own will than was' - heheld the baby up - 'this child."The Consul looked confused. He started to speak, shook his headinstead.'That may be correct,' said Colonel Fedmahn Kassad, 'but however theymay try to use all of us as pawns, we must attempt to choose our ownactions." He glanced up at the wall where pulses of light from thedistant space battle painted the plaster blood red. 'Because of thiswar, thousands will die. Perhaps millions. If the Ousters or theShrike gain access to the Web's farcaster system, billions of lives onhundreds of worlds are at risk."The Consul watched as Kassad raised the deathwand.'This would be faster for all of us,' said Kassad. 'The Shrike knows nomercy."No one spoke. The Consul seemed to be staring at something at a greatdistance.Kassad pressed on the safety and set the wand back in his belt. 'We'vecome this far,' he said. 'We will go the rest of the way together."Brawne Lamia put away her father's pistol, rose, crossed the smallspace, knelt next to the Consul, and put her arms around him. Startled,the Consul raised one arm. Light danced on the wall behind them.A moment later, Sol Weintraub came close andhugged them both with one arm around their shoulders.The baby wriggled in pleasure at the sudden warmth of bodies. TheConsul smelled the talc-and-newborn scent of her.'I was wrong,' said the Consul. 'I will make a reqtlest of the Shrike.I will ask for her." He gently touched Rache!'s head where the smallskull curved in to neck.Martin Silenus made a noise which began as a laugh and died as a sob.'Our last requests,' he said. 'Does the muse grant requests? I have norequest. I want only for the poem to be finished."Father Hoyt turned toward the poet. 'Is it so important?"'Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes,' gasped Silenus. He dropped the empty Scotchbottle, reached into his bag, and lifted out a handful of flimsies,holding them high as if offering them to the group. 'Do you want toread it? Do you want me to read it to you? It's flowing again. Readthe old parts. Read the Cantos I wrote three centuries ago and neverpublished. It's all here. We're all here. My name, yours, this trip.Don't you see... I'm not creating a poem, I'm creating the future!" Helet the flimsies fall, raised the empty bottle, frowned, and held itlike a chalice. 'I'm creating the future,' he repeated without lookingup, 'but it's the past which must be changed.One instant. One decision."Martin Silenus raised his face. His eyes were red. 'This thing that isgoing to kill us tomorrow - my muse, our maker, our unmaker - it'straveled back through time.Well, let it. This time, let it take me and leave Billy alone.Let it take me and let the poem end there, unfinished for all time." Heraised the bottle higher, closed his eyes, and threw it against the farwall. Glass shards reflected orange light from the silent explosions.Colonel Kassad stepped closer and laid long fingers on the poet'sshoulder.For a few seconds the room seemed warmed by the mere fact of humancontact. Father Lenar Hoyt stepped away from the wall where he had beenleaning, raised his right hand with thumb and little finger touching,three fingers raised, the gesture somehow including himself aswell as those before him, and said softly, 'Ego te absolvo. 'Wind scraped at the outer walls and whistled around the gargoyles andbalconies. Light from a battle a hundred million kilometers awaypainted the group in blood hues.Colonel Kassad walked to the doorway. The group moved apart.'Let's try to get some sleep,' said Brawne Lamia.Later, alone in his bedroll, listening to the wind shriek and howl, theConsul set his cheek against his pack and pulled the rough blankethigher. It had been years since he had been able to fall asleep easily.The Consul se[ his curled fist against his cheek, closed his eyes, andslept.EPILOGUEThe Consul awoke to the sound 'of a balalaika being played so softlythat at first he thought it was an undercurrent of his dream.The Consul rose, shivered in the cold air, wrapped his blanket aroundhim, and went out onto the long balcony.It was not yet dawn. The skies still burned with the light of battle.'I'm sorry,' said Lenar Hoyt, looking up from his instrument. Thepriest was huddled deep in his cape.'It's all right,' said the Consul. 'I was ready to awaken." It wastrue. He could not remember feeling more rested. 'Please continue,' hesaid. The notes were sharp and clear but barely audible above the windnoise. It was as if Hoyt was playing a duet with the cold wind from thepeaks above. The Consul found the clarity almost painful.Brawne Lamia and Colonel Kassad came out. A minute later Sol Weintraubjoined them. Rachel twisted in his arms, reaching toward the night skyas if she could grasp the bright blossoms there.Hoyt played. The wind was rising in the hour before dawn, and thegargoyles and escarpments acted' like reeds to the Keep's cold bassoon.Martin Silenus emerged, holding his head. 'No fucking respect for ahangover,' he said. He leaned on the broad railing. 'If I barf fromthis height, it'll be half an hour before the vomitus lands."Father Hoyt did not look up. His fingers flew across the strings of thesmall instrument. The northwest wind grew stronger and colder and thebalalaika playedcounterpart, its notes warm and alive. The Consul and the othershuddled in blankets and capes as the breeze grew to a torrent and theunnamed music kept pace with it. It was the strangest and mostbeautiful symphony the Consul had ever heard.The wind gusted, roared, peaked, and died. Hoyt ended his tune.Brawne Lamia looked around. 'It's almost dawn." 'We have another hour,'said Colonel Kassad.Lamia shrugged. 'Why walt?"'Why indeed?" said Sol Weintraub. He looked to the east where the onlyhint of sunrise was the faintest of palings in constellations there. 'Itlooks like a good day is coming."'Let's get ready,' said Hoyt. 'Do we need our luggage?"The group looked at one another.'No, I think not,' said the Consul. 'The Colonel will bring the comlogwith the fatline communicator.Bring anything necessary for your audience with the Shrike. We'll leavethe rest of the stuff here."'All right,' said Brawne Lamia, turning back from the dark doorway,gesturing toward the others, 'let's do it."There were six hundred and sixty-one steps from the northeast portal ofthe Keep to the moor below. There were no railings. The groupdescended carefully, watching their step in the insecure light.Once onto the valley floor, they looked back at the outcrop of stoneabove. Chronos Keep looked like part of the mountain, its balconies andexternal stairways mere slashes in the rock. Occasionally a brighterexplosion would illuminate a window or throw a gargoyle shadow, butexcept for those instances it was as if the Keep had vanished behindthem.They crossed the low hills below the Keep, staying on grass and avoidingthe sharp shrubs which extended thorns like claws. In ten minutes theyhad crossed to sand and were descending low dunes toward the valley.Brawne Lamia led the group. She wore her finest cape and a red silksuit with black trim. Her cornlog gleamed on her wrist. Colonel Kassadcame next. He was in full battle armor, camouflage polymer not yetactivated so the suit looked matte black, absorbing even the light fromabove. Kassad carried a standard-issue FORCE assault rifle. His visorgleamed like a black mirror.Father Hoyt wore his black cape, black suit, and clerical collar. Thebalalaika was cradled in his arms like a child. He continued to set hisfeet carefully, as if each step caused pain. The Consul followed. Hewas dressed in his diplomatic best, starched blouse, formal blacktrousers and demi-jacket, velvet cape, and the gold tricome he had wornthe first day on the treeship.He had to keep a grip on the hat against the wind that had come upagain, hurling grains of sand in his face and sliding across the dunetops like a serpent. Martin Silenus followed close behind in his coatof wind-rippled fur.So! Weintraub brought up the rear. Rachel rode in the infant carrier,nestled under the cape and coat against her father's chest. Weintraubwas singing a low tune to her, the notes lost in the breeze.Forty minutes out and they had come even with the dead city. Marble andgranite gleamed in the violet light. The peaks glowed behind them, theKeep indistinguishable from the other mountain-sides. The group crosseda sandy vale, climbed a low dune, and suddenly the head of the valley ofthe Time Tombs was visible for the first time. The Consul could makeout the thrust of the Sphinx's wings and a glow of jade.A rumble and crash from far behind them made the Consul turn, startled,his heart pounding.'Isn't it beginning?" asked Lamia. 'The bombardment?" 'No, look,' saidKassad. He pointed to a point abovethe mountain peaks where blackness obliterated the stars. Lightningexploded along the false horizon, illuminating icefields and glaciers.'Only a storm,' he said.They resumed their trek across vermilion sands. The Consul foundhimself straining to make out the shape of a figure near the Tombs or atthe head of the valley. He was certain beyond all certainty thatsomething awaited them there . . . that itawaited.'Look at that,' said Brawne Lamia, her whisper almost lost in the wind.The Time Tombs were glowing. What the Consul had first taken to belight reflected from above was not.Each Tomb glowed a different hue and each was clearly visible now, theglow brightening, the Tombs receding far back into the darkness of thevalley. The air smelled of ozone.'Is that a common phenomenon?" asked Father Hoyt, his voice thin.The Consul shook his head. 'l've never heard of it." 'It had never beenreported at the time Rachel came to study the Tombs,' said SolWeintraub. He began to hum the low tune as the group started forwardagain through shifting sands.They paused at the head of the valley. Soft dunes gave way to rock andink-black shadows at the swale which led down to the glowing Tombs. Noone led the way. No one pokc. The Consul felt his heart beating wildlyagainst his ribs. Worse than fear or knowledge of what lay below wasthe blackness of spirit which seemed to have come into him on the wind,chilling him and making him want to run screaming toward the hills fromwhich they had come.The Consul turned to Sol Weintraub. 'What's that tune you're singing toRachel?"The scholar forced a grin and scratched his short beard. 'It's from anancient flat film. Pre-Hegira. Hell, it's pre-everything."'Let's hear it,' said Brawne Lamia, understand ing what the Consul wasdoing. Her face was very pale.Weintraub sang it, his voice thin and barely audible at first. But thetune was forceful and oddly compelling.Father Hoyt uncradled the balalaika and played along, the notes gainingconfidence.Brawne Lamia laughed. Martin Silenus said in awe, 'My God, I used tosing this in my childhood. It's ancient."'But who is the wizard?" asked Colonel Kassad, the amplified voicethrough his helmet oddly amusing in this context.'And what is Oz?" asked Lamia.'And just who is off to see this wizard?" asked the Consul, feeling theblack panic in him fade ever so slightly.Sol Weintraub paused and tried to answer their questions, explaining theplot of a flat film which had been dust for centuries.'Never mind,' said Brawne Lamia. 'You can tell us later. Just sing itagain."Behind them, the darkness had engulfed the mountains as the storm sweptdown and across the moors toward them. The sky continued to bleed lightbut now the eastern horizon had paled slightly more than the rest. Thedead city glowed to their left like stone teeth.Brawne Lamia took the lead again. Sol Weintraub sang more loudly,Rachel wiggling in delight. Lenar Hoyt threw back his cape so as tobetter play the balalaika. Martin Silenus threw an empty bottle far outonto the sands and sang along, his deep voice surprisingly strong andpleasant above the wind.Fedmahn Kassad pushed up his visor, shouldered his weapon, and joined inthe chorus. The Consul started to sing, thought about the absurdlyrics, laughed aloud, and started again.Just where the darkness began, the trail broadened.The Consul moved to his right, Kassad joining him, Sol Weintraub fillingthe gap, so that instead of a single-fileprocession, the six adults were walking abreast. Brawne Lamia tookSilenus's hand in hers, joined hands with Sol on the other side.Still singing loudly, not looking back, matching stride for stride, theydescended into the valley.
